       " 'For the sermon itself is brought to a close in such a way, that it is clear there are in it all  the precepts which go to mould the life.',\n",
       " 'For thus He speaks: “Therefore, whosoever heareth these words of mine, and doeth them, I will liken.',\n",
       " 'The beginning, then, of this sermon is introduced as follows: “And when He saw the great.',\n",
       " 'What, then, does He say?',\n",
       " '“Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.” We read in Scripture concerning the striving after temporal things, “All is vanity and presumption of spirit;”.',\n",
       " '“Blessed are the meek, for they shall by inheritance possessshall by inheritance possess the earth,” from which they cannot be driven out.. “Blessed are they that mourn:.',\n",
       " '“Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled.” Now He calls those parties, lovers of a true and indestructible good.',\n",
       " 'They will therefore be filled with that food of which the Lord Himself says, “My meat is to do the will of my Father,” which is righteousness; and with that water, of which whosoever “drinketh,” as he also says, it “shall be in him a well of water, springing up into everlasting life.”.',\n",
       " '“Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy.”.',\n",
       " '“Blessed are the pure in heart:.',\n",
       " '“Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God.” It is the perfection of peace, where nothing offers opposition; and the children of God are peacemakers, because nothing resists God, and surely children ought to have the likeness of their father.',\n",
       " 'Now, they are peacemakers in themselves who, by bringing in order all the motions of their soul, and subjecting them to reason—.',\n",
       " 'There are in all, then, these eight sentences.',\n",
       " 'For now in what remains He speaks in the way of direct address to those who were present, saying: “Blessed shall ye be when men shall revile you and persecute you.” But the former sentences He addressed in a general way: for He did not say, Blessed are ye poor in spirit, for yours is the kingdom of heaven; but He says, “Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven:” nor, Blessed  are ye meek, for ye shall inherit the earth; but, “Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.” And so the others up to the eighth sentence, where He says: “Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness’ sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.” After that He now begins to speak in the way of direct address to those present, although what has been said before referred also to His present audience; and that which follows, and which seems to be spoken specially  to those present, refers also to those who were absent, or who would afterwards come into existence.For this reason the number of sentences before us is to be carefully considered.',\n",
       " 'For the beatitudes begin with humility: “Blessed are the poor in spirit,”.',\n",
       " 'Hence also the sevenfold operation of the Holy Ghost, of which Isaiah speaks,ourselves forgiven; and that we assist others so far as we  are able, as we ourselves desire to be assisted where we are not able: and of them it is here said, “Blessed are the merciful.” Understanding corresponds to the pure in heart, the eye being as it were purged, by which that may be beheld which eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, and what hath not entered into the heart of man:.',\n",
       " 'Moreover, the one reward, which is the kingdom of heaven, is variously named according to these stages.',\n",
       " 'In the first, just as ought to be the case, is placed the kingdom of heaven, which is the perfect and highest wisdom of the rational soul.',\n",
       " 'Thus, therefore, it is said, “Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven:” as if it were said, “The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.” To the meek an inheritance is given, as it were  the testament of a father to those dutifully seeking it: “Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.” To the mourners comfort, as to those who know what they have lost, and in what evils they are sunk: “Blessed are they that mourn, for they shall be comforted.” To those hungering and thirsting, a full supply, as it were a refreshment to those labouring and bravely contending for salvation: “Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness, for they shall be  filled.” To the merciful mercy, as to those following a true and excellent counsel, so that this same treatment is extended toward them by one who is stronger, which they extend toward the weaker: “Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy.” To the pure in heart is given the power of seeing God, as to those bearing about with them a pure eye for discerning eternal things: “Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.” To the peacemakers the likeness of God is  given, as being perfectly wise, and formed after the image of God by means of the regeneration of the renewed man: “Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the children of God.” And those promises can indeed be fulfilled in this life, as we believe them to have been fulfilled in the case of the apostles.',\n",

       " '“Blessed,” therefore, “are they which are  persecuted for righteousness’ sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.” This eighth sentence, which goes back to the starting-point, and makes manifest the perfect man, is perhaps set forth in its meaning both by the circumcision on the eighth day in the Old Testament, and by the resurrection of the Lord after the Sabbath, the day which is certainly the eighth, and at the same time the first day; and by the celebration of the eight festival days which we celebrate in the case of the  regeneration of the new man; and by the very number of Pentecost.',\n",
       " 'For to the number seven, seven times multiplied, by which we make forty-nine, as it were an eighth is added, so that fifty may be made up, and we, as it were, return to the starting-point: on which day the Holy Spirit was sent, by whom we are led into the kingdom of heaven, and receive the inheritance, and are comforted; and are fed, and obtain mercy, and are purified, and are made peacemakers; and being thus perfect, we bear all  troubles brought upon us from without for the sake of truth and righteousness.. “Blessed are ye,” says He, “when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely for my sake.',\n",
       " 'Rejoice and be exceeding glad: for greatwhere there is no love, there cannot be righteousness, for “love worketh no ill to his neighbour;”.',\n",

       " '“Rejoice,” says He, “and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in heaven.” I do not think that it is the higher parts of this visible world that are here called heaven.',\n",
       " 'For our reward, which ought to be immoveable and eternal, is not to be placed in things fleeting and temporal.',\n",
       " 'But I think the expression “in heaven” means in the spiritual firmament, where dwells everlasting righteousness: in comparison with which a wicked soul is called  earth, to which it is said when it sins, “Earth thou art, and unto earth thou shalt return.”.',\n",
       " 'Hence there follows most justly the statement, “Ye are the salt of the earth;” showing that those parties are to be judged insipid, who, either in the eager pursuit after abundance of earthly blessings, or through the dread of want, lose the eternal things which can neither be given nor taken away by men.',\n",
       " '“But.',\n",
       " '“Ye are the lightearth,” so now He says, “the light of the world.” For in the former case that earth is not to be understood which we tread with our bodily feet, but the men who dwell upon the earth, or even the sinners, for the preserving of whom and for the extinguishing of whose corruptions the Lord sent the apostolic salt.',\n",
       " 'And here, by the world must be understood not the heavens and the  earth, but the men who are in the world or love the world, for the enlightening of whom the apostles were sent.. “Let your light,”had heard only, that he which persecuted us in times past now preacheth the faith which once he destroyed; and they glorified.',\n",
       " 'And therefore, after He has exhorted His hearers that they should prepare themselves to bear all things for truth and righteousness, and that they should not hide the good which they were about to receive, but should learn with such benevolence as to teach others, aiming in their good works not at their own praise, but at the glory of God, He begins now to inform and to teach them what they are to teach; as if they were asking Him, saying: Lo, we are willing both to  bear all things for Thy name, and not to hide Thy doctrine; but what precisely is this which Thou forbiddest us to hide, and for which Thou commandest us to bear all things?',\n",
       " 'Art Thou about to mention other things contrary to those which are written in the law?',\n",
       " '“No,” says He; “for think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil.”.',\n",
       " 'In this sentence the meaning is twofold.. “For I say unto you, that except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven;”fore, shall break those least commandments, and shall teach men so, shall be called the least; but whosoever shall do those least commandments, and shall teach men so, is  not necessarily to be reckoned great and meet for the kingdom of heaven; but yet he is not so much the least as the man who breaks them.',\n",
       " 'But in order that he may be great and fit for that kingdom, he ought to do and teach as Christ now teaches,.',\n",
       " '“Ye have heard” therefore, says He, “that it was said to them of old time, Thou shalt not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment.',\n",
       " 'But I say unto you, that whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause.',\n",
       " 'But here one obscure word has found a place, for “Raca” is neither Latin nor Greek.',\n",
       " 'The others, however, are current in our language.',\n",
       " 'Now, some have wished to derive the interpretation of this expression from the Greek, supposing that a ragged person is called “Raca,” because a rag is called in Greek.',\n",
       " 'There is therefore a gradation in the sins referred to, so that first one is angry, and keeps that feeling as a conception in his heart; but if now that emotion shall draw forth an expression of anger not having any definite meaning, but giving evidence of that feeling of the mind by the very fact of the outbreak wherewith he is assailed with whom one is angry, this is certainly more than if the rising anger were restrained by silence; but if there is heard not  merely an expression of anger, but also a word by which the party using it now indicates and signifies a distinct censure of him against whom it is directed, who doubts but that this is something more than if merely an exclamation of anger were uttered?',\n",
       " 'Hence in the first there is one thing, compels us to acknowledge that there is a certain difference in this place, the production of the sentence seems to belong to the council, inasmuch as it is not now the case of the accused himself that is  in question, whether he is to be condemned or not, but they who judge confer with one another to what punishment they ought to condemn him, who, it is clear, is to be condemned; but the gehenna of fire does not treat as a doubtful matter either the condemnation, like the judgment, or the punishment of him who is condemned, like the council; for in the gehenna of fire both the condemnation and the punishment of him who is condemned are certain.',\n",
       " 'Thus there are seen certain degrees in the sins and  in the liability to punishment;.',\n",
       " 'Indeed, in the three statements before us, we must observe that some words are understood.',\n",
       " 'For the first statement has all the words that are necessary.',\n",
       " '“Whosoever,” says He, “is angry with his brother without a cause, shall be in danger of the judgment.” But in the second, when He says, “and whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca,” there is understood the expression.',\n",
       " 'Next there follows here: “Therefore, if thou hast brought.',\n",
       " 'And so we may interpret the altar spiritually, as being faith itself in the inner temple of God, whose emblem is the visible altar.',\n",
       " 'For whatever offering we present to God, whether prophecy, or teaching, or prayer, or a psalm, or a hymn, and whatever other such like spiritual gift occurs to the mind, it cannot be acceptable to God, unless it be sustained by sincerity of faith, and, as it were, placed on that fixedly and immoveably, so that what we  utter may remain whole and uninjured.',\n",
       " 'For many heretics, not having the altar,.',\n",
       " 'But who acts in a way that he is neither angry with his brother without a cause, nor says “Raca” without a cause, nor calls him a fool without a cause, all of which are most proudly committed; or so, that, if perchance he has fallen into any of these, he asks pardon with suppliant mind, which is the only remedy; who but just the man that is not puffed up with the spirit of empty boasting?',\n",
       " '“Blessed” therefore “are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the  kingdom of heaven.” Let us look now at what follows.. “Be kindly disposed,”.',\n",
       " 'But now, with respect to paying the uttermost farthing,correct life?',\n",
       " 'For perhaps the expression “till thou hast paid” stands here in the same sense as in that passage where it is said, “Sit Thou at my right hand, until I make Thine enemies Thy footstool;”.',\n",
       " 'But let us now see who the adversary himself is, with whom we are enjoined to agree quickly, whiles we are in the way with him.',\n",
       " 'For he is either the devil, or a man, or the flesh, or God, or His commandment.. Perhaps, therefore, we are enjoined to yield to God, and to be well-disposed towards Him, in order that we may be reconciled to Him, from whom by sinning we have turned away, so that He can be called our adversary.',\n",
       " 'For He is rightly called the adversary of those whom He resists, for “God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace to the humble;”there; if I make my bed in hell, behold, Thou art there.',\n",
       " 'If I take the wings of the morning, and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea; even there shall Thy hand lead me, and Thy right hand shall hold me.”.',\n",
       " '“Ye have heard that it was said to them of old time, Thou shalt not commit adultery: but I say unto you, that whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her, hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.” The lesser righteousness, therefore, is not to commit adultery by carnal connection; but the greater righteousness of the kingdom of God is not to commit adultery in the heart.',\n",
       " 'Now, the man who does not commit adultery in the heart, much more  easily guards against committing adultery in actual fact.',\n",
       " 'Hence He who gave the later precept confirmed the earlier; for He came not to destroy the law, but to fulfil it.',\n",
       " 'It is well worthy of consideration that He did not say, Whosoever lusteth after a woman, but,” Whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her,”.',\n",
       " 'For there are three things which go to complete sin: the suggestion of, the taking pleasure in, and the consenting to.',\n",
       " 'Suggestion takes place either by means of memory, or by means of the bodily senses, when we see, or hear, or smell, or taste, or touch anything.',\n",
       " 'And if it give us pleasure to enjoy this, this pleasure, if illicit, must be restrained.',\n",
       " 'Just as when we are fasting, and on seeing food the appetite of the palate is stirred up, this does not happen  without pleasure; but we do not consent to this liking, andfied and extinguished; but afterwards, when the suggestion is repeated, a greater pleasure is kindled, which, however, is as yet much less than that which by continuous practice is converted into habit.',\n",
       " 'For it is very difficult to overcome  this; and yet even habit itself, if one does not prove untrue to himself, and does not shrink back in dread from the Christian warfare, he will get the better of under His (.',\n",
       " 'Hence, just as we arrive at sin by three steps,—suggestion, pleasure, consent,—so of sin itself there are three varieties,—in heart, in deed, in habit,—as it were, three deaths: one, as it were, in the house,.',\n",
       " 'And therefore, under the category of the adultery mentioned in this section, we must understand all fleshly and sensual lust.',\n",
       " 'For when Scripture so constantly speaks of idolatry as fornication, and the Apostle Paul calls avarice by the name of idolatry,.',\n",
       " 'In the next place, He goes on to say: “And if thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should go.',\n",
       " 'But since He follows it up with a similar statement respecting the right hand, “If thy right hand offend thee, cut it off, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should gothe necessities of the body; concerning which as a cause of stumbling it was superfluous to speak, inasmuch as not even the right was to be spared.',\n",
       " 'Now, a counsellor in divine things is a cause of stumbling, if he endeavours to lead one into any dangerous heresy under the guise of religion and doctrine.',\n",
       " 'Hence also let the right hand be taken in the sense of a beloved helper and assistant in divine works: for in like manner as contemplation is  rightly understood as having its seat in the eye, so action in the right hand; so that the left hand may be understood in reference to works which are necessary for this life, and for the body.. “It hath been said, Whosoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a writing of divorcement.” This is the lesser righteousness of the Pharisees, which is not opposed by what our Lord says: “But I say unto you, That whosoever shall put away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, causeth her to commit adultery:.',\n",
       " 'But it is rather that statement which the Lord Himself makes in another passage which is wont to disturb the minds of the little ones, who nevertheless earnestly desire to live now according to the precepts of Christ: “If any man come to me, and hate not his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple.”a man may love his enemies, and hate his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brothers!',\n",
       " 'For He commands both things who calls us to the kingdom of heaven.',\n",
       " 'And how these things do not contradict each other, it is easy to show under His guidance; but after they have been understood, it is difficult to carry them out, although this too is very easy when He Himself assists us.',\n",
       " 'For in that  eternal kingdom to which He has vouchsafed to call His disciples, to whom He also gives the name of brothers, there are no temporal relationships of this sort.',\n",

       " 'Unless, perhaps, the distinction should rather be drawn in this way: that the first case which is supposed, in reference to the cheek being  struck, means all injuries that are inflicted by the wicked in such a way that restitution cannot be made except by punishment; and that the second case which is supposed, in reference to the garment, means all injuries where restitution can be made without punishment; and therefore, perhaps, it is added, “if any man will sue thee at the law,” because what is taken away by means of a judicial sentence is not supposed to be taken away with such a degree of violence as that punishment is due;  but that the third case is composed of both, so that restitution may be made both without punishment and with it.',\n",
       " 'For the man who violently exacts labour to which he has no claim, without any judicial process, as he does who wickedly compels a man to go with him, and forces in an unlawful way assistance to be rendered to himself by one who is unwilling, is able both to pay the penalty of his wickedness and to repay the labour, if he who endured the wrong should ask it again.',\n",

       " 'Here again, however, it may happen that a difficulty will be found, and that some, seeing that Matthew has told us how Joseph was afraid to go into Judæa with the child on his return, expressly for the reason that Archelaus the son reigned there in place of his father Herod, may be led to ask how he could have gone into Galilee, where, as Luke bears witness, there was another son of that Herod, namely, Herod the tetrarch.',\n",
       " 'But such a difficulty can only be founded  on the fancy that the times indicated as those in which there was such apprehension on the child’s account were identical with the times dealt with now by Luke: whereas it is conspicuously evident that there is a change in the periods, because we no longer find Archelaus represented as king in Judæa; but in place of him we have Pontius Pilate, who also was not the king of the Jews, but only their governor, in whose times the sons of the elder Herod, acting under Tiberius Cæsar, held not the  kingdom, but the tetrarchy.',\n",
       " 'And all this certainly had not come to pass at the time when Joseph, in fear of the Archelaus who was then reigning in Judæa, betook himself, together with the child, into Galilee, where was also his city Nazareth.. Or may a question perchance be raised as to how Matthew tells us that His parents went with the boy Jesus into Galilee, because they were unwilling to go into Judæa in consequence of their fear of Archelaus; whereas it would rather appear that the reason for their going into Galilee was, as Luke has not failed to indicate, the consideration that their city was Nazareth of Galilee?',\n",
       " 'Well, but we must observe, that when the angel said to Joseph in his dreams in  Egypt, “Arise, and take the young child and His mother, and go into the land of Israel,”.',\n",
       " 'Or does any one put to us this question, How was it, then, that His parents went up to Jerusalem every year during the boyhood of Christ, as Luke’s narrative bears, if they were prevented from going there by the fear of Archelaus?',\n",
       " 'Well, I should not deem it any very difficult task to solve this question, even although none of the evangelists has given us to understand how long Archelaus reigned there.',\n",
       " 'For it might have been the case that, simply for that one  day, and with the intention of returning forthwith, they went up on the day of the feast, without attracting any notice among the vast multitudes then assembled, to the city where, nevertheless, they were afraid to make their residence on other days.',\n",
       " 'And thus they might at once have saved themselves from the appearance of being so irreligious as to neglect the observance of the feast, and have avoided drawing attention upon themselves by a continued sojourn.',\n",
       " 'But further, although all the  evangelists have omitted to tell us what was the length of the reign of Archelaus, we have still open to us this obvious method of explaining the matter, namely, to understand the custom to which Luke refers, when he says that they were in the habit of going to Jerusalem every year,.',\n",
       " 'Hereby also we see how another question is solved, if any one indeed finds a difficulty in it.',\n",
       " 'I allude to the question as to how it was possible, on the supposition that the elder Herod was already anxious (to obtain information regarding Him), and agitated by the intelligence received from the wise men concerning the birth of the King of the Jews, for them, when the days of the purification of His mother were accomplished, to go up in any safety with Him to  the temple, in order to see to the performance of those things which were according to the law of the Lord, and which are specified by Luke.anxiety, and engaged rather with the devising of measures to ward off other more instantly threatening perils?',\n",
       " 'Wherefore, leaving all such considerations unspecified, I simply venture on the assertion that, when the wise men failed to bring back any  report to him, Herod may have believed that they had been misled by a deceptive vision of a star, and that, after their want of success in discovering Him whom they had supposed to have been born, they had been ashamed to return to him; and that in this way the king, having his fears allayed, had given up the idea of asking after and persecuting the child.',\n",
       " 'Consequently, when they had gone with Him to Jerusalem after the purification of His mother, and when those things had been performed in the  temple which are recounted by Luke,.',\n",
       " 'Moreover, Matthew makes up his account of John in the following manner:—Now in those days came John the Baptist, preaching in the wilderness of Judæa, and saying, Repent ye, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.',\n",
       " 'For this is He that is spoken of by the prophet Esaias, saying, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make His paths straight.locusts and wild honey.',\n",
       " 'Mark also gives us this same statement almost in so many words.',\n",
       " 'But the other two evangelists omit it.. Matthew then proceeds with his narrative, and says: Then went out to him Jerusalem and all Judæa, and all the region round about Jordan, and were baptized by him in Jordan, confessing their sins.',\n",
       " 'But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come to his baptism, he said unto them, O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?',\n",

       " 'For now the axe is laid unto the root of the trees: therefore every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit, shall be hewn down and cast into the fire.',\n",
       " 'I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance; but He that is to come after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear: He shall baptize you in the Holy Spirit and fire: whose fan is in His hand, and He will  thoroughly purge His floor, and gather His wheat into the garner; but He will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire..',\n",
       " 'If now the question is asked, as to which of the words we are to suppose the most likely to have been the precise words used by John the Baptist, whether those recorded as spoken by him in Matthew’s Gospel, or those in Luke’s, or those which Mark has introduced, among the few sentences which he mentions to have been uttered by him, while he omits notice of all the rest, it will not be deemed worth while creating any difficulty for oneself in a matter of that  kind, by any one who wisely understands that the real requisite in order to get at the knowledge of the truth is just to make sure of the things really meant, whatever may be the precise words in which they happen to be expressed.',\n",
       " 'For although one writer may retain a certain order in the words, and another present a different one, there is surely no real contradiction in that.',\n",
       " 'Nor, again, need there be any antagonism between the two, although one may state what another omits.',\n",
       " 'For it is evident  that the evangelists have set forth these matters just in accordance with the recollection each retained of them, and just according as their several predilections prompted them to employ greater brevity or richer detail on certain points, while giving, nevertheless, the same account of the subjects themselves..',\n",
       " 'Thus, too, in what more pertinently concerns the matter in hand, it is sufficiently obvious that, since the truth of the Gospel, conveyed in that word of God which abides eternal and unchangeable above all that is created, but which at the same time has been disseminated.',\n",
       " 'With respect, then, to those comparisons which I have instituted between the several narratives of the evangelists, what do these present that must be considered to be of a contradictory order?',\n",
       " 'Are we to regard in this light the circumstance that one of them has given us the words, “whose shoes I am not worthy to bear,” whereas the others speak of the “unloosing of the latchet of the shoe”?',\n",
       " 'For here, indeed, the difference seems to be neither in the mere  words, nor in the order of the words, nor in any matter of simple phraseology, but in the actual matter of fact, when in the one case the “bearing of the shoe” is mentioned, and in the other the “unloosing of the shoe’s latchet.” Quite fairly, therefore, may the question be put, as to what it was that John declared himself unworthy to do—whether to bear the shoes, or to unloose the shoe’s latchet.',\n",
       " 'For if only the one of these two sentences was uttered by him, then that evangelist  will appear to have given the correct narrative who was in a position to record what was said; while the writer who has given the saying in another form, although he may not indeed have offered an [intentionally] false account of it, may at any rate be taken to have made a slip of memory, and will be reckoned thus to have stated one thing instead of another.',\n",
       " 'It is only seemly, however, that no charge of absolute unveracity should be laid against the evangelists, and that, too, not  only with regard to that kind of unveracity which comes by the positive telling of what is false, but also with regard to that which arises through forgetfulness.',\n",
       " 'Therefore, if it is pertinent to the matter to deduce one sense from the words “to bear the shoes,” and another sense from the words “to unloose the shoe’s latchet,” what should one suppose the correct interpretation to be put on the facts, but that John did give utterance to both these sentences, either on two different  occasions or in one and the same connection?',\n",
       " 'For he might very well have expressed himself thus, “whose shoe’s latchet I am not worthy to unloose, and whose shoes I am not worthy to bear:” and then one of the evangelists may have reproduced the one portion of the saying, and the rest of them the other; while, notwithstanding this, all of them have really given a veracious narrative.',\n",
       " 'But further, if, when he spoke of the shoes of the Lord, John meant nothing more than to convey the idea of  His supremacy and his own lowliness, then, whichever of the two sayings may have actually been uttered by him, whether that regarding the unloosing of the latchet of the shoes, or that respecting the bearing of the shoes, the self-same sense is still correctly preserved by any writer who, while making mention of the shoes in words of his own, has expressed at the same time the same idea of lowliness, and thus has not made any departure from the real mind [of the person of whom he writes].',\n",
       " 'It is  therefore a useful principle, and one particularly worthy of being borne in mind, when we are speaking of the concord of the evangelists, that there is no divergence [to be supposed] from truth, even when they introduce some saying different from what was actually uttered by the person concerning whom the narrative is given, provided that, notwithstanding this, they set forth as his mind precisely what is also so conveyed by that one among them who reproduces the words as they were literally  spoken.',\n",
       " 'For thus we learn the salutary lesson, that our aim should be nothing else than to ascertain what is the mind and intention of the person who speaks.. Matthew then continues his narrative in the following terms: “Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John, to be baptized of him.',\n",
       " 'But John forbade Him, saying, I have need to be baptized of Thee, and comest Thou to me?',\n",
       " 'And Jesus answering, said unto him, Suffer it to be so now; for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness.',\n",
       " 'Then he suffered Him.”.',\n",
       " 'Thereafter Matthew proceeds thus: “And Jesus, when He was baptized, went up straightway out of the water; and, lo, the heavens were opened unto Him, and He saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting upon Him; and, lo, a voice from heaven saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.” This incident is also recorded in a similar manner by two of the others, namely Mark and Luke.',\n",
       " 'But at the same time, while preserving the sense  intact, they use different modes of expression in reproducing the terms of the voice which came from heaven.',\n",
       " 'For although Matthew tells us that the words were, “This is my beloved Son,” while the other two put them in this form, “Thou art my beloved Son,” these different methods of speech serve but to convey the same sense, according to the principle which has been discussed above.',\n",
       " 'For the heavenly voice gave utterance only to one of these sentences; but by the form of words thus  adopted, namely, “This is my beloved Son,” it was the evangelist’s intention to show that the saying was meant to intimate specially to the hearers there [and not to Jesus] the fact that He was the Son of God.',\n",
       " 'With this view, he chose to give the sentence, “Thou art my beloved Son,” this turn, “This is my beloved Son,” as if it were addressed directly to the people.',\n",
       " 'For it was not meant to intimate to Christ a fact which He knew already; but the object was to let the people who  were present hear it, for whose sakes indeed the voice itself was given.',\n",
       " 'But furthermore now, with regard to the circumstance that the first of them puts the saying thus, “In whom I am well pleased,”reach a more adequate  conception of the saying than might have been the case with only one form, and that they also secure it against being interpreted in a sense not consonant with the real state of the case.',\n",
       " 'For as to the sentence, “In whom I am well pleased,”.',\n",
       " 'Again, the account of the dove given in the Gospel according to John does not mention the time at which the incident happened, but contains a statement of the words of John the Baptist as reporting what he saw.',\n",
       " 'In this section, the question rises as to how it is said, “And I knew Him not: but He that sent me to baptize with water, the same said unto me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending and remaining on Him, the same is He which baptizeth with  the Holy Spirit.”.',\n",
       " 'Matthew proceeds with his narrative in these terms: “Then was Jesus led up of the Spirit into the wilderness, to be tempted of the devil.',\n",
       " 'And when He had fasted forty days and forty nights, he was afterward an hungered.',\n",
       " 'And when the tempter came to Him, he said, If thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread.',\n",
       " 'But He answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of  God.',\n",
       " 'And so the account continues, until we come to the words, Then the devil left.',\n",
       " 'Matthew’s narrative is continued thus: “Now when Jesus had heard that John was cast into prison, He departed into Galilee.”.',\n",
       " 'After this, Matthew goes on with his narrative in these terms: “And leaving the city of Nazareth, He came and dwelt in Capharnaum, which is upon the sea-coast, in the borders of Zabulon and Nephthalim;” and so forth, until we come to the conclusion of the sermon which He delivered on the mount.',\n",
       " 'In this section of the narrative, Mark agrees with him in attesting the calling of the disciples Peter and Andrew, and a little after that, the calling of James and  John.',\n",
       " 'But whereas Matthew introduces in this immediate context his account of that lengthened sermon which He delivered on the mount, after He cured a multitude, and when great crowds followed Him, Mark has inserted other matters at this point, touching His teaching in the synagogue, and the people’s amazement at His doctrine.',\n",
       " 'Then, too, he has stated what Matthew also states, although not till after that lengthened sermon has been given, namely, that “He taught them as one that had  authority, and not as the scribes.” He has likewise given us the account of the man out of whom the unclean spirit was cast; and after that the story of Peter’s mother-in-law.',\n",
       " 'In these things, moreover, Luke is in accord with him..',\n",
       " 'In this paragraph, moreover, which we are at present considering, the same Matthew follows up his account of the calling of those disciples to whom, when they were engaged in fishing, He gave the command to follow Him, by a narrative to the effect that He went about Galilee, teaching in the synagogues, and preaching the gospel, and healing all manner of sickness; and that when multitudes had gathered about Him, He went up into a mountain, and delivered that  lengthened sermon [already alluded to].',\n",
       " 'Thus the evangelist gives us ground for understanding that those incidents which are recorded by Mark after the election of those same disciples, took place at the period when He was going about Galilee, and teaching in their synagogues.',\n",
       " 'We are at liberty also to suppose that what happened to Peter’s mother-in-law came in at this point; and that he has mentioned at a later stage what he has passed over here, although he has not indeed brought up at that  later point, for direct recital, everything else which is omitted at the earlier..',\n",
       " 'The question may indeed be raised as to how John gives us this account of the calling of the disciples, which is to the effect that, certainly not in Galilee, but in the vicinity of the Jordan, Andrew first of all became a follower of the Lord, together with another disciple whose name is not declared; that, in the second place, Peter got that name from Him; and thirdly, that Philip was called to follow Him; whereas the other three evangelists, in a satisfactory  concord with each other, Matthew and Mark in particular being remarkably at one here, tell us that the men were called when they were engaged in fishing.',\n",
       " 'Luke, it is true, does not mention Andrew by name.',\n",
       " 'Nevertheless, we can gather that he was in that same vessel, from the narrative of Matthew and Mark, who furnish a concise history of the manner in which the affair was gone about.',\n",
       " 'Luke, however, presents us with a fuller and clearer exposition of the circumstances, and  gives us also an account of the miracle which was performed there in the haul of fishes, and of the fact that previous to that the Lord spake to the multitudes when He was seated in the boat.',\n",
       " 'There may also seem to be a discrepancy in this respect, that Luke records the saying, “From henceforth thou shalt catch men,”.',\n",
       " 'For [it is noticeable that] again in Cana of Galilee, after He had turned the water into wine, this same John tells us how His disciples believed on Him.',\n",
       " 'The narrative of that miracle proceeds thus: “And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the mother of Jesus was there.',\n",
       " 'And both Jesus was called and His disciples to the marriage.”.',\n",
       " 'But further, as to John’s statement, that “after this He went down to Capharnaum, He and His mother, and His brethren and His disciples; and they continued there not many days;”only person, however, who received a separate name from Him was Peter..',\n",
       " 'Besides, we ought certainly to note the fact that the evangelical and apostolical Scriptures do not confine this designation of His “disciples” to those twelve alone, but give the same appellation to all those who believed on Him, and were educated under His instruction for the kingdom of heaven.',\n",
       " 'Out of the whole number of such He chose twelve, whom He also named apostles, as Luke mentions.',\n",
       " 'For a little further on he says: And He came down with them, and  stood in the plain, and the concourse.',\n",
       " 'But the question may be asked, how He called the fishermen from their boats two by two, namely, calling Peter and Andrew first, and then going forward a little and calling other two, namely the sons of Zebedee, according to the narratives of Matthew and Mark; whereas Luke’s version of the matter is, that both their boats were filled with the immense haul of fishes.',\n",
       " 'And his statement bears further, that Peter’s partners, to wit, James and John, the sons of  Zebedee, were summoned to the men’s help when they were unable to drag out their crowded nets, and that all who were there were astonished at the enormous draught of fishes which had been taken; and that when Jesus said to Peter, “Fear not, from henceforth thou shall catch men,” although the words had been addressed to Peter alone, they all nevertheless followed Him when they had brought their ships to land..',\n",
       " 'Furthermore, we must consider the question how the evangelist John, before there is any mention of the casting of John the Baptist into prison, tells us that Jesus went into Galilee.',\n",
       " 'For, after relating how He turned the water into wine at Cana of Galilee, and how He came down to Capernaum with His mother and His disciples, and how they abode there not many days, he tells us that He went up then to Jerusalem on account of the passover; that after this He came  into the land of Judæa along with His disciples, and tarried there with them, and baptized; and then in what follows at this point the evangelist says: “And John also was baptizing in Ænon, near to Salim, because there was much water there; and they came, and were baptized: for John was not yet cast into prison.”Galilee, which took place after John’s imprisonment, regarding which return into Galilee the evangelist John himself furnishes the following notice: “When, therefore, Jesus knew how the Pharisees had heard that Jesus makes and baptizes more disciples than John (though Jesus Himself baptized not, but His disciples), he left Judæa, and departed again into Galilee.”.',\n",
       " 'Now, regarding that lengthened sermon which, according to Matthew, the Lord delivered on the mount, let us at present see whether it appears that the rest of the evangelists stand in no manner of antagonism to it.',\n",
       " 'Mark, it is true, has not recorded it at all, neither has he preserved any utterances of Christ’s in any way resembling it, with the exception of certain sentences which are not given connectedly, but occur here and there, and which the Lord  repeated in other places.',\n",
       " 'Nevertheless, he has left a space in the text of his narrative indicating the point at which we may understand this sermon to have been spoken, although it has been left unrecited.',\n",
       " 'That is the place where he says: “And He was preaching in their synagogues, and in all Galilee, and was casting out devils.”.',\n",
       " 'This leper is also referred to by Luke,.',\n",
       " 'This we might very well suppose to have been the case, as I have said, were it not that a difficulty is felt to attach to the circumstance that Matthew tells us how this discourse was delivered on a mount by the Lord in a sitting posture; while Luke says that it was spoken on a plain by the Lord in a standing posture.',\n",
       " 'This difference, accordingly, makes it seem as if the former referred to one discourse, and the latter to another.',\n",
       " 'And what should there be, indeed,  to hinder [us from supposing] Christ to have repeated elsewhere some words which He had already spoken, or from doing a second time certain things which He had already done on some previous occasion?',\n",
       " 'However, that these two discourses, of which the one is inserted by Matthew and the other by Luke, are not separated by a long space of time, is with much probability inferred from the fact that, at once in what precedes and in what follows them, both the evangelists have related  certain incidents either similar or perfectly identical, so that it is not unreasonably felt that the narrations of the writers who introduce these things are occupied with the same localities and days.',\n",
       " 'For Matthew’s recital proceeds in the following terms: “And there followed Him great multitudes of people from Galilee, and from Decapolis, and from Jerusalem, and from Judæa, and from beyond Jordan.',\n",
       " 'And seeing the multitudes, He went up into a mountain; and when He was set, His disciples  came unto Him: and He opened His mouth, and taught them, saying, Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven;”.',\n",
       " 'But, again, as regards what Matthew proceeds to state after the termination of that discourse—namely this, “And it came to pass, when Jesus had ended these sayings, the people.',\n",
       " 'After all, however, this explanation may also be suggested,—namely, that in the first instance the Lord, along with His disciples and no others, was on some more elevated portion of the mountain, and that during the period of His stay there He chose out of the number of His followers those twelve; that then He came down in company with them, not indeed from the mountain itself, but from that said altitude on the mountain, into the plain—that is to say, into some  level spot which was found on the slope of the mountain, and which was capable of accommodating great multitudes; and that thereafter, when He had seated Himself, His disciples took up their position next Him, and in these circumstances He delivered both to them and to the other multitudes who were present one discourse, which Matthew and Luke have both recorded, their modes of narrating it being indeed different, but the truth being given with equal fidelity by the two writers in all that  concerns the facts and sayings which both of them have recounted.',\n",
       " 'For we have already prefaced our inquiry with the position, which indeed ought of itself to have been obvious to all without the need of any one to give them counsel to that effect beforehand, that there is not [necessarily] any antagonism between writers, although one may omit something which another mentions; nor, again, although one states a fact in one way, and another in a different method, provided that the  same truth is set forth in regard to the objects and sayings themselves.',\n",
       " 'In this way, therefore, Matthew’s sentence, “Now when He was come down from the mountain,” may at the same time be understood to refer also to the plain, which there might very well have been on the slope of the mountain.',\n",
       " 'And thereafter Matthew tells the story of the cleansing of the leper, which is also given in a similar manner by Mark and Luke.. After these things, Matthew proceeds with his narrative in the following terms: “And when Jesus was entered into Capharnaum, there came unto Him a centurion, beseeching Him, and saying, Lord, my servant lieth at home sick of the palsy, and he is grievously tormented;” and so forth, on to the place where it is said, “And his servant was healed in the self-same hour.”.',\n",
       " 'Accordingly, let us proceed to consider whether Matthew and Luke are at one in the account of this servant.',\n",
       " 'Matthew’s words, then, are these: “There came unto Him a centurion, beseeching Him, and saying, My servant lieth at home sick of the palsy.”with an approach on the part of  the centurion to the Lord, which was effected in the person of others, to have chosen to express the matter in this compendious method, “There came a centurion to Him.”.',\n",
       " 'At the same time, however, we must be careful enough to discern a certain mystical depth in the phraseology adopted by the evangelist, which is in accordance with these words of the Psalm, “Come ye to Him, and be ye lightened.”.',\n",
       " 'Matthew proceeds in the following terms: “And when Jesus was come into Peter’s house, He saw his wife’s mother laid, and sick of a fever.',\n",
       " 'And He touched her hand, and the fever left her: and she arose, and ministered unto them.”.',\n",
       " 'But as to the reason why the Holy Spirit, who divideth to every man severally as He will,proposed to ourselves is simply to demonstrate that not one of the evangelists contradicts either himself or his fellow-historians, whatever be the precise order in which he may have had the ability or may have preferred to compose his account of matters belonging to the doings and sayings of Christ; and that, too, at once in the case of subjects  identical with those recorded by others, and in the case of subjects different from these.',\n",
       " 'For this reason, therefore, when the order of times is not apparent, we ought not to feel it a matter of any consequence what order any of them may have adopted in relating the events.',\n",
       " 'But wherever the order is apparent, if the evangelist then presents anything which seems to be inconsistent with his own statements, or with those of another, we must certainly take the passage into consideration, and  endeavour to clear up the difficulty.. Matthew, accordingly, continues his narration thus: “Now when the even was come, they brought unto Him many that were possessed with devils; and He cast out the spirits with His word, and healed all that were sick: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying, Himself took our infirmities, and bare our sicknesses.”.',\n",
       " 'He next appends the following statement: “And a certain scribe came and said unto Him, Master, I will follow Thee whithersoever thou goest;” and so on, down to the words, “Let the dead bury their dead.”inserts it only after a variety of other matters, and without any explicit note of the order of time, but after the fashion of one only bethinking himself of the incident at that point.',\n",
       " 'He leaves us also uncertain whether he brings it in there as something previously omitted, or as an anticipatory notice of something which in actual fact took place subsequently to those incidents by which it  is followed in the history.',\n",
       " 'For he proceeds thus: “And it came to pass, that as they went in the way, a certain man said unto Him, I will follow Thee whithersoever Thou goest.”.',\n",
       " '“And when He was entered into a ship, His disciples followed Him.',\n",
       " 'And, behold, there arose a great tempest in the sea.” And so the story goes on, until we come to the words, “And He came into His own city.”and the sea obey Him?”.',\n",
       " 'Moreover, with respect to the circumstance that Matthew states that there were two men who were afflicted with the legion of devils which received permission to go into the swine, whereas Mark and Luke instance only a single individual, we may suppose that one of these parties was a person of some kind of superior notability and repute, whose case was particularly lamented by that district, and for whose deliverance there was special anxiety.',\n",
       " 'With the  intention of indicating that fact, two of the evangelists have judged it proper to make mention only of the one person, in connection with whom the fame of this deed had been spread abroad the more extensively and remarkably.',\n",
       " 'Neither should any scruple be excited by the different forms in which the words uttered by the possessed.',\n",
       " 'Hereupon Matthew proceeds with his recital, still preserving the order of time, and connects his narrative in the following manner:—“And He entered into a ship, and passed over, and came into His own city.',\n",

       " 'A difficulty, however, may certainly arise when we observe how Matthew tells the story of the paralytic after this fashion: “And He entered into a ship, and passed over, and came into His own city.',\n",
       " 'And, behold, they brought to Him a man sick of the palsy, lying on a bed;” whereas Mark speaks of the incident as taking place not in His own city, which indeed is called Nazareth, but in Capharnaum.',\n",
       " 'His narrative is to the following effect:—“And again He  entered into Capharnaum after some days; and it was noised that He was in the house.',\n",
       " 'And straightway many were gathered together, insomuch that there was no room to receive them, no, not so much as about the door: and He spake a wordand so forth.. Matthew next continues his narrative in the following terms:—“And as Jesus passed forth from thence, He saw a man named Matthew, sitting at the receipt of custom: and He saith unto him, Follow me.',\n",
       " 'And he arose and followed Him.”.',\n",
       " 'Matthew, accordingly, goes on to say: “And it came to pass, as He sat at meat in the house, behold, many publicans and sinners came and sat down with Jesus and His disciples;” and so on, down to where we read, “But they put new wine into new bottles, and both are preserved.”.',\n",
       " 'Let us next look into the words which these three evangelists have all brought in as having been addressed to the Lord, and also into the replies which were made by Him.',\n",
       " 'Matthew says: “And when the Pharisees saw it, they said unto His disciples, Why eateth your Master with publicans and sinners?”.',\n",
       " 'In the same way, we may subject what is said about the disciples of John to examination.',\n",
       " 'Matthew’s words are these: “Then came to Him the disciples of John, saying, Why do we and the Pharisees fast oft?”.',\n",
       " 'Once more, we find that Matthew and Mark have given similar accounts of what was said about the children of the bridegroom not fasting as long as the bridegroom is with them, with this exception, that Mark has named them the children of the bridals,.',\n",
       " 'Still keeping by the order of time, Matthew next continues to the following effect: “While He spake these things unto them, behold, there came a certain ruler, and worshipped Him, saying, My daughter is even now dead; but come and lay Thy hand upon her, and she shall live;” and so on, until we come to the words, “and the maid arose.',\n",
       " 'And the fame hereof went abroad into all that land.”.',\n",
       " 'In this narrative, then, which we have undertaken to consider at present, all these three evangelists indeed are unquestionably at one in the account which they give of the woman who was afflicted with the issue of blood.',\n",
       " 'Nor is it a matter of any real consequence, that something which is passed by in silence by one of them is related by another; or that Mark says, “Who touched my clothes?” while Luke says, “Who touched me?” For the one has only adopted the  phrase in use and wont, whereas the other has given the stricter expression.',\n",
       " 'But for all that, both of them convey the same meaning.',\n",
       " 'For it is more usual with us to say, “You are tearing me,”.',\n",
       " 'At the same time, however, there remains the fact that Matthew represents the ruler of the synagogue to have spoken to the Lord of his daughter, not merely as one likely to die, or as dying, or as on the very point of expiring, but as even then dead; while these other two evangelists report her as now nigh unto death, but not yet really dead, and keep so strictly to that version of the circumstances, that they tell us how the persons came at a later stage with  the intelligence of her actual death, and with the message that for this reason the Master ought not now to trouble Himself by coming, with the purpose of laying His hand upon her, and so preventing her from dying,—the matter not being put as if He was one possessed of ability to raise the once dead to life.',\n",
       " 'It becomes necessary for us, therefore, to investigate this fact lest it may seem to exhibit any contradiction between the accounts.',\n",
       " 'And the way to explain it is to suppose that, by  reason of brevity in the narrative, Matthew has preferred to express it as if the Lord had been really asked to do what it is clear He did actually do, namely, raise the dead to life.',\n",
       " 'For what Matthew directs our attention to, is not the mere words spoken by the father about his daughter, but what is of more importance, his mind and purpose.',\n",
       " 'Thus he has given words calculated to represent the father’s real thoughts.',\n",
       " 'For he had so thoroughly despaired of his child’s case, that not believing  that she whom he had just left dying, could possibly now be found yet in life, his thought rather was that she might be made alive again.',\n",
       " 'Accordingly two of the evangelists have introduced the words which were literally spoken by Jairus.',\n",
       " 'But Matthew has exhibited rather what the man secretly wished and thought.',\n",
       " 'Thus both petitions were really addressed to the Lord; namely, either that He should restore the dying damsel, or that, if she was already dead, He might raise her to life again.',\n",
       " 'But as  it was Matthew’s object to tell the whole story in short compass, he has represented the father as directly expressing in his request what, it is certain, had been his own real wish, and what Christ actually did.',\n",
       " 'It is true, indeed, that if those two evangelists, or one of them, had told us that the father himself spake the words which the parties who came from his house uttered,—namely, that Jesus should not now trouble Himself, because the damsel had died,—then the words which Matthew  has put into his mouth would not be in harmony with his thoughts.',\n",
       " 'But, as the case really stands, it is not said that he gave his consent to the parties who brought that report, and who bade the Master no more think of coming now.',\n",
       " 'And together with this, we have to observe, that when the Lord addressed him in these terms, “Fear not: believe only, and she shall be made whole,”.',\n",
       " 'Seeing, then, that the case stands thus, from these varied and yet not inconsistent modes of statement adopted by the evangelists, we evidently learn a lesson of the utmost utility, and of great necessity,—namely, that in any man’s words the thing which we ought narrowly to regard is only the writer’s thought which was meant to be expressed, and to which the words ought to be subservient; and further, that we should not suppose one to be giving an incorrect  statement, if he happens to convey in different words what the person really meant whose words he fails to reproduce literally.',\n",
       " 'And we ought not to let the wretched cavillers at words fancy that truth must be tied somehow or other to the jots and tittles of letters; whereas the fact is, that not in the matter of words only, but equally in all other methods by which sentiments are indicated, the sentiment itself, and nothing else, is what ought to be looked at..',\n",
       " 'Moreover, as to the circumstance that some codices of Matthew’s Gospel contain the reading, “For the womanthis damsel of twelve years of age was already married, or had known a man.. Matthew proceeds with his narrative in the following terms: “And when Jesus departed thence, two blind men followed Him, crying and saying, Thou son of David, have mercy on us;” and so on, down to the verse where we read, “But the Pharisees said, He casteth out devils through the prince of the devils.”.',\n",
       " 'As to the events next related, it is true that their exact order is not made apparent by Matthew’s narrative.',\n",
       " 'For after the notices of the two incidents in connection with the blind men and the dumb demoniac, he continues in the following manner: “And Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the kingdom of the gospel,power and the counsels given to the disciples, and that indeed with as great brevity as Mark.. Another question which it is also usual to put is this: How comes it that Matthew and Luke have stated that the Lord said to His disciples that they were not to take a staff with them, whereas Mark puts the matter in this way: “And He commanded them that they should take nothing for their journey, save a staff only;”.',\n",
       " 'And there are many other words which do not retain one uniform signification, but are introduced so as to suit a variety of connections, and thus are understood in a variety of ways, and sometimes, indeed, are adopted along with an explanation.',\n",
       " 'We have an example in the saying, “Be not childrenkind, not to mention, in the meantime, also other metaphorical significations of this phrase..',\n",
       " 'Both these counsels, therefore, must be accepted as having been spoken by the Lord to the apostles; namely, at once that they should not take a staff, and that they should take nothing save a staff only.',\n",
       " 'For when He said to them, according to Matthew, “Provide neither gold nor silver, nor money in your purses, nor scrip for your journey, neither two coats, neither shoes, nor yet a staff,” He added immediately, “for the workman is worthy of his meat.”  And by this He makes it sufficiently obvious why it is that He would have them provide and carry none of these things.',\n",
       " 'He shows that His reason was, not that these things are not necessary for the sustenance of this life, but because He was sending them in such a manner as to declare plainly that these things were due to them by those very persons who were to hear believingly the gospel preached by them; just as wages are the soldier’s due, and as the fruit of the vine is the right of the  planters, and the milk of the flock the right of the shepherds.',\n",
       " 'For which reason Paul also speaks in this wise: “Who goeth a warfare any time at his own charges?',\n",
       " 'who planteth a vineyard, and eateth not of the fruit thereof?',\n",
       " 'who feedeth a flock, and eateth not of the milk of the flock?”.',\n",
       " 'Accordingly, as our Lord ordained what the apostle declares Him to have ordained,—namely, that those who preach the gospel should live of the gospel,—He gave these counsels to the apostles in order that they might be without the care of providing.',\n",
       " 'In like manner, also, when Matthew tells us that the shoes were not to be carried with them on the journey, what is intended is the checking of that care which thinks that such things must be carried with them, because otherwise they might be unprovided.',\n",
       " 'Thus, too, the import of what is said regarding the two coats is, that none of them should think of taking with him another coat in addition to the one in which he was clad, as if he was afraid that he  might come to be in want, while all the time the power (which was received from the Lord) made him sure of getting what was needful.',\n",
       " 'To the same effect, when Mark says that they were to be shod with sandals or soles, he gives us to understand that this matter of the shoe has some sort of mystical significance, the point being that the foot is to be neither covered, nor yet left bare to the ground; by which the idea may be conveyed that the gospel was neither to be concealed, nor yet made to  depend on the good things of earth.',\n",
       " 'And as to the fact that what is forbidden is neither the carrying nor the possessing of two coats, but more distinctly the putting of them on,—the words being, “and not put on two coats,”—what counsel is conveyed to them therein but this, that they ought to walk not in duplicity, but in simplicity?.',\n",
       " 'Thus it is not by any means to be made a matter of doubt that the Lord Himself spake all these words, some of them with a literal import, and others of them with a figurative, although the evangelists may have introduced them only in part into their writings,—one inserting one section, and another giving a different portion.',\n",
       " 'Certain passages, at the same time, have been recorded in identical terms either by some two of them, or by some three, or even by all  the four together.',\n",
       " 'And yet not even when this is the case can we take it for granted that everything has been committed to writing which was either uttered or done by Him.',\n",
       " 'Moreover, if any one fancies that the Lord could not in the course of the same discourse have used some expressions with a figurative application and others with a literal, let him but examine His other addresses, and he will see how rash and inconsiderate such a notion is.',\n",

       " 'In good truth, I must repeat here once more an admonition which it behoves the reader to keep in mind, so as not to be requiring that kind of advice so very frequently, namely, that in various passages of His discourses, the Lord has reiterated much which He had uttered already on other occasions.',\n",
       " 'It is needful, indeed, to call this fact to mind, lest, when it happens that the order of such passages does not appear to fit in with the narrative of another of the  evangelists, the reader should fancy that this establishes some contradiction between them; whereas he ought really to understand it to be due to the fact that something is repeated a second time in that connection which had been already expressed elsewhere.',\n",
       " 'And this is a remark that should be held applicable not only to His words, but also to His deeds.',\n",
       " 'For there is nothing to hinder us from believing that the same thing may have taken place more than once.',\n",
       " 'But for a man to impeach the gospel  simply because he does not believe in the repeated occurrence of some incident, which no one [at least] can prove to be an impossible event, betrays mere sacrilegious vanity..

       " 'Now, when John had heard in the prison the works of Christ, he sent two of his disciples, and said unto Him, Art thou He that should come, or do we look for another?” and so on, until we come to the words, “And Wisdom is justified of her children.”.',\n",

       " 'This circumstance makes it the rather appear that Luke has recorded these words in the strict consecution in which they were spoken by the Lord, while Matthew has kept by the order of his own recollections.',\n",
       " 'Or if it is supposed that Matthew’s words, “Then began He to upbraid  the cities,” must be taken in such a way as to imply that the intention was to express, by the term “then,” the precise point of time at which the saying was uttered, and not to signify in a somewhat broader way the period at which many of these things were done and spoken, then I say that any one entertaining that idea may equally well believe these sentences to have been pronounced on two different occasions.',\n",
       " 'For if it is the fact that even in one and the same evangelist some things are  found which the Lord utters twice over, as is the case with this very Luke in the instance of the counsel not to take a scrip for the journey, and so with other things in like manner which we find to have been spoken by the Lord in two different places,.',\n",
       " 'Matthew proceeds thus: “At that time Jesus answered and said, I make my acknowledgment to Thee,.',\n",

       " 'Accordingly, when Matthew says, “And when He was departed thence, He came into their synagogue,” the words do indeed import that  the said coming did not take place until after He had departed from the previously mentioned locality; but, at the same time, they leave the question undecided as to the number of days which may have elapsed between His passing from the aforesaid corn-field and His coming into their synagogue; and they express nothing as to His going there in direct and immediate succession.',\n",

       " 'This inference is confirmed by the fact that Mark keeps by the same order.. Matthew thence proceeds as follows: “And it came to pass that, when Jesus had finished these parables, He departed thence: and when He was come into His own country, He taught them in their synagogues;”.',\n",

       " 'The correctness of this principle may be gathered most clearly from the fact that, at a point antecedent to any account given by him of anything done by the Lord at Capharnaum, Luke has anticipated the literal date, and has inserted this  passage which we have at present under consideration, and in which we are told how His fellow-citizens at once were astonished at the might of the authority which was in Him, and expressed their contempt for the meanness of His family.',\n",

Matthew then proceeds and carries on his narrative in due consecution to the said incident connected with the five loaves in the following manner: “And when it was evening, His disciples came to Him, saying, This is a desert place, and the time is now past; send the multitude away, that they may go into the villages, and buy themselves victuals.',\n",

As far as the order or method of statement here adopted is concerned, we ought to understand that it in no way affects the truth of the subject itself, whether the question regarding the permission to write a bill of divorcement given by the said Moses, by whom also it is recorded that God made male and female to be one flesh,.',\n",
       " 'Another view of the matter may also be taken, namely, that, in accordance with Mark’s statement, when these persons began by questioning the Lord on the subject of the putting away of a wife, He questioned them in turn as to what Moses commanded them; and that, on their replying that Moses suffered them to write a bill of divorcement and put the wife away, He made His answer to them regarding the said law which was given by Moses, reminding them how God  instituted the union of male and female, and addressing them in the words which are inserted by Matthew, namely, “Have ye not read that He which made them at the beginning made them male and female?” and so on.',\n",
       " 'On hearing these words, they repeated in the form of an inquiry what they had already given utterance to when replying to His first interrogation, namely the expression, “Why did Moses then command to give a writing of divorcement, and to put her away?” Then Jesus showed that the  reason was the hardness of their heart; which explanation Mark brings in, with a view to brevity, at an earlier point, as if it had been given in reply to that former response of theirs, which Matthew has passed over.',\n",
       " 'And this he does as judging that no injury could be done to the truth at whichever point the explanation might be introduced, seeing that the words, with a view to which it was returned, had been uttered twice in the same form; and seeing also that the Lord, in any case, had  offered the said explanation in reply to such words.. Matthew proceeds thus: “Then were there brought unto Him little children, that He should put His hands on them, and pray; and the disciples rebuked them;” and so on, down to where we read, “For many are called, but few are chosen.”who introduces the section relating to the labourers who were hired for the vineyard.',\n",
       " 'Luke, on the other hand, first mentions what He said to those who were asking each other who should be the greatest, and next subjoins at once the passage concerning the man whom they had seen casting out devils, although he did not follow Him; then he parts company with the other two at the point where he tells us how He stedfastly set  His face to go to Jerusalem;.',\n",
