       " 'So it is that  sacred doctrine is a science because it proceeds from principles established by the light of a higher science, namely, the science of God and the blessed.',\n",
       " 'The unity of a faculty or habit is to be gauged by its object, not indeed, in its material aspect, but as regards the precise formality under which it is an object.',\n",
       " 'For example, man, ass, stone agree in the one precise formality of being colored; and color is the formal object of sight.',\n",
       " 'Hence, although among the philosophical sciences one is speculative and another practical, nevertheless sacred doctrine includes both; as God, by one and the same science, knows both Himself and His works.',\n",
       " 'Now one speculative science is said to be nobler than another, either by reason of its greater certitude, or by reason of the higher worth of its subject-matter.',\n",
       " \"In both these respects this science surpasses other speculative sciences; in point of greater certitude, because other sciences derive their certitude from the natural light of human  reason, which can err; whereas this derives its certitude from the light of divine knowledge, which cannot be misled: in point of the higher worth of its subject-matter because this science treats chiefly of those things which by their sublimity transcend human reason; while other sciences consider only those things which are within reason's grasp.\",\n",
       " 'Of the practical sciences, that one is nobler which is ordained to a further purpose, as political science is nobler than military science; for the  good of the army is directed to the good of the State.',\n",
       " 'Now properly speaking, the object of a faculty or habit is the thing under the aspect of which all things are referred to that faculty or habit, as man and stone are referred to the faculty of sight in that they are colored.',\n",
       " 'Hence colored things are the proper objects of sight.',\n",
       " 'But in sacred science, all things are  treated of under the aspect of God: either because they are God Himself or because they refer to God as their beginning and end.',\n",
       " 'Hence it follows that God is in very truth the object of this science.',\n",
       " 'This is clear also from the principles of this science, namely, the articles of faith, for faith is about God.',\n",
       " 'The object of the principles and of the whole science must be the same, since the whole science is contained virtually in its principles.',\n",
       " 'For God provides for everything according to the capacity of its nature.',\n",
       " 'Now it is natural to man to attain to intellectual truths through sensible objects, because all our knowledge originates from sense.',\n",
       " 'Hence in Holy Writ, spiritual truths are fittingly taught under the likeness of material things.',\n",
       " 'Hier.',\n",
       " 'i:  \"We cannot be enlightened by the divine rays except they be hidden within the covering of many sacred veils.\"',\n",
       " 'So, whereas in every other science things are signified by words, this science has the property, that the things signified by the words have themselves also a signification.',\n",
       " 'Therefore that first signification whereby words signify things belongs to the first sense, the historical or literal.',\n",
       " 'That signification  whereby things signified by words have themselves also a signification is called the spiritual sense, which is based on the literal, and presupposes it.',\n",
       " 'Now this spiritual sense has a threefold division.',\n",
       " 'A proposition is self-evident because the predicate is included in the essence of the subject, as \"Man is an animal,\" for animal is contained in the essence of man.',\n",
       " 'If, therefore the essence of the predicate and subject be known to all, the proposition will be self-evident to all; as is clear with  regard to the first principles of demonstration, the terms of which are common things that no one is ignorant of, such as being and non-being, whole and part, and such like.',\n",
       " 'If, however, there are some to whom the essence of the predicate and subject is unknown, the proposition will be self-evident in itself, but not to those who do not know the meaning of the predicate and subject of the proposition.',\n",
       " 'The other is through the effect, and is called a demonstration \"a posteriori\"; this is to argue from what is prior relatively only to us.',\n",
       " 'First, because no body is in motion unless it be put in motion, as is evident from induction.',\n",
       " 'First, because matter is in potentiality.',\n",
       " 'To understand this, it must be noted that in things composed of matter and form, the nature or essence must differ from the \"suppositum,\" because the essence or nature connotes only what is included in the definition of the species; as, humanity connotes all that is included in the definition of man, for it is by this that man is man, and it is this that humanity signifies, that, namely, whereby man is man.',\n",
       " 'Now  individual matter, with all the individualizing accidents, is not included in the definition of the species.',\n",
       " 'Therefore \"suppositum\" and nature in them are identified.',\n",
       " 'This may be shown in several ways.',\n",
       " 'First, whatever a thing has besides its essence must be caused either by the constituent principles of that essence like a property that necessarily accompanies the species---as the faculty of laughing is proper to a man---and is caused by the constituent principles of the species, or by some exterior agent---as heat is caused  in water by fire.',\n",
       " 'Therefore, if the existence of a thing differs from its essence, this existence must be caused either by some exterior agent or by its essential principles.',\n",
       " \"Now it is impossible for a thing's existence to be caused by its essential constituent principles, for nothing can be the sufficient cause of its own existence, if its existence is caused.\",\n",
       " 'Therefore that thing, whose existence differs from its essence, must have its existence caused by another.',\n",
       " 'But this cannot be true of  God; because we call God the first efficient cause.',\n",
       " 'Therefore it is impossible that in God His existence should differ from His essence.',\n",
       " 'Secondly, existence is that which makes every form or nature actual; for goodness and humanity are spoken of as actual, only because they are spoken of as existing.',\n",
       " 'Therefore existence must be compared to essence, if the latter is a distinct reality, as actuality to potentiality.',\n",
       " 'But in neither way is God in a genus.',\n",
       " 'That He cannot be a species of any genus may be shown in three ways.',\n",
       " 'First, because a  species is constituted of genus and difference.',\n",
       " 'Now that from which the difference constituting the species is derived, is always related to that from which the genus is derived, as actuality is related to potentiality.',\n",
       " 'Rational being, on the other hand, is derived from intellectual nature, because that is rational, which has an intellectual nature, and intelligence is  compared to sense, as actuality is to potentiality.',\n",
       " 'The same argument holds good in other things.',\n",
       " 'Hence since in God actuality is not added to potentiality, it is impossible that He should be in any genus as a species.',\n",
       " 'Secondly, since the existence of God is His essence, if God were in any genus, He would be the genus \"being\", because, since genus is predicated as an essential it refers to the essence of a thing.',\n",
       " 'iii that being cannot be a genus, for  every genus has differences distinct from its generic essence.',\n",
       " 'Now no difference can exist distinct from being; for non-being cannot be a difference.',\n",
       " 'It follows then that God is not in a genus.',\n",
       " 'essence---must differ.',\n",
       " 'But in God they do not differ, as shown in the preceding article.',\n",
       " 'Therefore it is plain that God is not in a genus as if He were a species.',\n",
       " 'From this it is also plain that He has no genus nor difference, nor can there be any definition of Him; nor, save through His effects, a demonstration of Him: for a definition is from genus and difference; and the mean of a demonstration is a definition.',\n",
       " 'But God is the principle of all being.',\n",
       " 'First, because a subject is compared to its accidents as potentiality to actuality; for a subject is in some sense made actual by its accidents.',\n",
       " 'This is practically the same as the opinion of those who assert that God is the soul of the highest heaven.',\n",
       " 'Again, others have said that God is the formal principle of all things; and this was the theory of the Almaricians.',\n",
       " 'The third error is that of David of Dinant, who most absurdly taught that God was primary matter.',\n",
       " 'Now all these contain manifest untruth; since it is not possible for God to enter into the composition of anything, either as a formal or a material principle.',\n",
       " 'First, because God is the first efficient cause.',\n",
       " 'But primary matter can be neither numerically nor specifically identical with an efficient cause; for the former is merely potential, while the latter is  actual.',\n",
       " 'Secondly, because, since God is the first efficient cause, to act belongs to Him primarily and essentially.',\n",
       " 'But that which enters into composition with anything does not act primarily and essentially, but rather the composite so acts; for the hand does not act, but the man by his hand; and, fire warms by its heat.',\n",
       " 'Hence God cannot be part of a compound.',\n",
       " 'Thirdly, because no part of a compound can be absolutely primal among beings---not even matter, nor form, though they are the primal  parts of every compound.',\n",
       " 'xii, some ancient philosophers, namely, the Pythagoreans and Leucippus, did not predicate \"best\" and \"most perfect\" of the first principle.',\n",
       " 'The reason was that the ancient philosophers considered only a material principle; and a material principle is most imperfect.',\n",
       " 'For since matter as such is merely potential, the first material principle must be simply potential, and thus most imperfect.',\n",
       " 'Now God is the first principle,  not material, but in the order of efficient cause, which must be most perfect.',\n",
       " 'For just as matter, as such, is merely potential, an agent, as such, is in the state of actuality.',\n",
       " 'v any excellence which may be found in any genus.',\n",
       " 'This may be seen from two considerations.',\n",
       " 'Now it is plain that the effect pre-exists virtually in the efficient cause: and although to pre-exist in the potentiality of a material cause is to pre-exist in a more imperfect way, since matter as such is imperfect, and an agent as such is perfect; still to pre-exist virtually in the efficient cause is to pre-exist not in a more imperfect, but in a more perfect way.',\n",
       " 'Since therefore God is the first effective  cause of things, the perfections of all things must pre-exist in God in a more eminent way.',\n",
       " 'Nom.',\n",
       " 'v: \"It is not that He is this and not that, but that He is all, as the cause of all.\"',\n",
       " 'In a third way some things are said to be alike which communicate in the same form, but not according to the same formality; as we see in non-univocal agents.',\n",
       " 'For since every agent reproduces itself so far as it is an agent, and everything acts  according to the manner of its form, the effect must in some way resemble the form of the agent.',\n",
       " \"If, however, the agent and its effect are not contained in the same species, there will be a likeness, but not according to the formality of the same species; as things generated  by the sun's heat may be in some sort spoken of as like the sun, not as though they received the form of the sun in its specific likeness, but in its generic likeness.\",\n",
       " 'Therefore if there is an agent not contained in any \"genus,\" its effect will still more distantly reproduce the form of the agent, not, that is, so as to participate in the likeness of the agent\\'s form according to the same specific or generic formality, but only according to some sort of analogy; as existence is common to all.',\n",
       " 'The essence of goodness consists in this, that it is in some way desirable.',\n",
       " 'i: \"Goodness is what all desire.\"',\n",
       " 'Now it is clear that a thing is desirable only in so far as it is perfect; for all desire their own perfection.',\n",
       " 'But everything is perfect so far as it is actual.',\n",
       " 'For the meaning signified by the name of a thing is that which the mind conceives of the thing and intends by the word that stands for it.',\n",
       " 'Therefore, that is prior in idea, which is first conceived by the intellect.',\n",
       " 'Now the first thing conceived by the intellect is being; because everything is knowable only inasmuch as it is in actuality.',\n",
       " 'Hence, being is the proper object of the intellect, and is primarily intelligible; as  sound is that which is primarily audible.',\n",
       " 'For all being, as being, has actuality and is in some way perfect; since every act implies some sort of perfection; and perfection implies desirability and goodness, as is clear from A.',\n",
       " 'Nevertheless, the idea of goodness presupposes the idea of an efficient cause, and also of a formal cause.',\n",
       " 'For we see that what is first in causing, is last in the thing caused.',\n",
       " 'Fire, e.g.',\n",
       " 'heats first of all before it reproduces the form of fire; though the heat in the fire follows from its substantial form.',\n",
       " 'Now in  causing, goodness and the end come first, both of which move the agent to act; secondly, the action of the agent moving to the form; thirdly, comes the form.',\n",
       " 'But if we consider the nature of goodness from a higher and more universal point of view, we shall find that this division properly concerns goodness as such.',\n",
       " 'Now the movement of a natural body is terminated by the end  absolutely; and relatively by the means through which it comes to the end, where the movement ceases; so a thing is called a term of movement, so far as it terminates any part of that movement.',\n",
       " 'Now the ultimate term of movement can be taken in two ways, either as the thing itself towards which it tends, e.g.',\n",
       " 'a place or form; or a state of rest in that thing.',\n",
       " 'For a thing is good according to its desirableness.',\n",
       " 'Now everything seeks after its own perfection; and the perfection and form of an effect consist in a certain likeness to the agent, since every agent makes its like; and hence the agent itself is desirable and has the nature of good.',\n",
       " 'For the very thing which is desirable in it is the participation of its likeness.',\n",
       " 'Nom.',\n",
       " 'For good is attributed to God, as was said in the preceding article, inasmuch as all desired perfections flow from Him as from the first cause.',\n",
       " 'For everything is called good according to its perfection.',\n",
       " 'Thus, for instance, the first perfection of fire consists in its existence, which it has through its own  substantial form; its secondary perfection consists in heat, lightness and dryness, and the like; its third perfection is to rest in its own place.',\n",
       " 'But as regards absolute things opinions differ.',\n",
       " 'iii, and with reason; for they considered that things flow forth infinitely from the first principle.',\n",
       " 'But because matter, considered as existing under some substantial form, remains in potentiality to many accidental forms, which is absolutely finite can be relatively infinite; as, for example, wood is finite according to  its own form, but still it is relatively infinite, inasmuch as it is in potentiality to an infinite number of shapes.',\n",
       " 'But if we speak of the infinite in reference to form, it is manifest that those things, the forms of which are in matter, are absolutely finite, and in no way infinite.',\n",
       " 'If, however, any created forms are not received into matter, but are self-subsisting, as some think is the case with angels, these will be relatively infinite, inasmuch as such kinds of forms are not terminated,  nor contracted by any matter.',\n",
       " 'Some, as Avicenna and Algazel, said that it was impossible for an actually infinite multitude to exist absolutely; but that an accidentally infinite multitude was not impossible.',\n",
       " 'For an agent must be joined to that wherein it acts immediately and touch it by its power; hence it is proved in Phys.',\n",
       " 'Now since God is very being by His own essence, created being must be His proper effect; as to ignite is the proper effect of fire.',\n",
       " 'Now God  causes this effect in things not only when they first begin to be, but as long as they are preserved in being; as light is caused in the air by the sun as long as the air remains illuminated.',\n",
       " 'Therefore as long as a thing has being, God must be present to it, according to its mode of being.',\n",
       " 'as one thing is said to be in another no matter how; and thus the accidents of a place are in place; or by a way proper to place; and thus things placed are in a place.',\n",
       " 'Now in both these senses, in some way God is in every place; and this is to be everywhere.',\n",
       " 'First, as He is in all things giving them being, power and operation; so He is in every  place as giving it existence and locative power.',\n",
       " 'In this second way God is especially in the rational creature which knows and loves Him actually or  habitually.',\n",
       " 'It belongs therefore to a thing to be everywhere absolutely when, on any supposition, it must be everywhere; and this properly belongs to God alone.',\n",
       " 'For whatever number of places be supposed, even if an infinite number be supposed besides what already exist, it would be necessary that God should be  in all of them; for nothing can exist except by Him.',\n",
       " 'First, because it was shown above that there is some first being, whom we call God; and that this first being must be pure act, without the admixture of any potentiality, for the reason that, absolutely, potentiality is posterior to act.',\n",
       " 'Now everything which is in any way changed, is in some way in potentiality.',\n",
       " 'Hence it is evident that it is impossible for God to be in any way changeable.',\n",
       " 'Secondly, because everything which is moved, remains as it was in part, and passes away in part; as what is moved from whiteness to blackness, remains the same as to substance; thus in everything which is moved, there is some kind of composition to be found.',\n",
       " 'Be it known therefore that a mutable thing can be called so in two ways: by a power in itself; and by a power possessed by another.',\n",
       " \"Therefore as it was in the Creator's power to produce them before they existed in themselves, so likewise it is in the Creator's power when they exist in themselves to bring them to nothing.\",\n",
       " 'For since succession occurs in every movement, and one part comes after another, the fact that we reckon before and after in movement, makes us apprehend time, which is nothing else but the measure of before and after in movement.',\n",
       " 'Now in a thing bereft  of movement, which is always the same, there is no before or after.',\n",
       " 'Supposing, however, that the aforesaid difference be considered on the part of the things measured, and not as regards the measures, then there is some reason for it, inasmuch as that alone is measured by time which has beginning and end in time.',\n",
       " 'This is the very reason why \"one\" is the same as \"being.\"',\n",
       " 'Now every being is either simple or compound.',\n",

       " 'The reason of this is that no effect results outside the order of a particular cause, except through some other impeding cause; which other cause must itself be reduced to the first universal cause; as indigestion may occur outside the order of the nutritive power by some such impediment as the coarseness of the food, which  again is to be ascribed to some other cause, and so on till we come to the first universal cause.',\n",
       " 'To make this clear, we must consider that a thing is preserved by another in two ways.',\n",

       " 'But this is impossible.',\n",
       " 'First, because the order of cause and effect would be taken away from created things: and this would imply lack of power in the Creator: for it is due to the power of the cause,  that it bestows active power on its effect.',\n",
       " 'Secondly, because the active powers which are seen to exist in things, would be bestowed on things to no purpose, if these wrought nothing through them.',\n",

       "'If, however, any created forms are not received into matter, but are self-subsisting, as some think is the case with angels, these will be relatively infinite, inasmuch as such kinds of forms are not terminated,  nor contracted by any matter.But others are subsisting natures, not residing in matter at all, which, however, are not their own existence, but receive it; and these are the incorporeal beings, called angels.And so those rational creatures  which were turned to God by free-will, were promoted to the order of angels according to the diversity of merits.By such knowledge the angels cannot know mysteries of grace.The more probable one holds that the angels were created at the same time as corporeal creatures.For the angels are part of the universe: they do not constitute a universe of themselves; but both they and corporeal natures unite in constituting one universe.If, then, in the angels we consider the proneness to sin, it seems that the higher angels were less likely to sin than the lower.Such a statement deprives angels and saints of true beatitude, because everlasting stability is of the very nature of true beatitude; hence it is termed \"life everlasting.\"But man s welfare is disposed by Divine providence in two ways: first of all, directly, when a man is brought unto good and withheld from evil; and this is fittingly done through the good angels.However, in some works translated from the Arabic, the separate substances which we call angels are called \"intelligences,\" and perhaps for this reason, that such substances are always actually understanding.Now we may consider four things in man: his \"reason,\" which makes him like to the angels ; his \"sensitive powers,\" whereby he is like the animals; his \"natural forces,\" which liken him to the plants; and \"the body itself,\" wherein he is like to inanimate things.Wherefore man had no mastership over the angels in the primitive state; so when we read \"all creatures,\" we must understand the creatures which are not made to God s image.xvii that in paradise the human race would have been multiplied by some other means, as the angels were multiplied without coition by the operation of the Divine Power.Now the end of the angels may be considered in two ways.First, according to the faculty of nature, so that they may know and love God by natural knowledge and love; and according to their relation to this end the orders of the angels are distinguished by natural gifts.This rests upon the fact that the guardianship of angels belongs to the execution of Divine providence concerning men.xxxiv in Evang., the different orders are deputed to the different \"genera\" of  things, for instance, the \"Powers\" to coerce the demons, the \"Virtues\" to work miracles in things corporeal; while it is probable that the different species are presided over by different angels of the same order.But nothing happens in the world contrary to the will of the angels and the other blessed, because they will cleaves entirely to the ordering of Divine justice; while nothing happens in the world save what is effected or permitted by Divine justice.The assault itself is due to the malice of the demons, who through envy endeavor to hinder man s progress; and through pride usurp a semblance of Divine power, by deputing certain ministers to assail man, as the angels of God in their various offices minister to man s salvation.that \"the gifts of God should be brought to men by means of the angels,\" there is a special reason why the Old Law should have been given through them.Now degrees among men are not unchangeable as among angels, because men are subject to many failings, so that he who is superior in one respect, is or may be inferior in another.But it is manifest that both men and angels are ordained to one end, which is the glory of the Divine fruition.Hence the mystical body of the Church consists not only of men but of angels.Now with regard to the first, the knowledge imprinted upon the soul of Christ was more excellent than the knowledge of the angels, both in the number of things known and in the certainty of the knowledge; since the spiritual light, which is imprinted on the soul of  Christ, is much more excellent than the light which pertains to the angelic nature.iv that angels, being nearer to God, have a greater share than men, in the effects of the Divine goodness.First, that in this also might be maintained the order established by God, by which Divine things are brought to men by means of the angels.iv that \"the angels were the first to be taught the Divine mystery of the loving kindness of Jesus: afterwards the grace of knowledge was imparted to us through  them.But the soul, even as it is immediately created by God, so will it be reunited to the body immediately by God without any operation of the angels: and in like manner He Himself will glorify the body without the ministry of the angels, just as He immediately glorifies man s soul.This ministry of the angels is  called their voice, according to one explanation given in the text Sent.One corresponds to the angels  personal merits and was made to both from the beginning when some were raised to bliss, and others plunged into the depths of woe.But considered under the aspect of dowry they are not as becoming to the angels as to men, because the character of bride is not so properly becoming to the angels as to men.on the other hand, He is not conformed to the angels in unity of species, neither as to His Divine nor as to His human nature.Now those things which make for perfect merit in man are connatural to angels, or belong to their state in general, or to their essential reward.'"
