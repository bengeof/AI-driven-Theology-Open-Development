       " 'Therefore, having nothing, neither righteousness nor works, to plead, his mouth is utterly stopped before God..',\n",
       " 'If then sinful men find favour with God, it is “grace upon grace!” If God vouchsafe still to pour fresh blessings upon us, yea, the greatest of all blessings, salvation; what can we say to these things, but, “Thanks be unto God for his unspeakable gift!” And thus it is.',\n",
       " 'herein “God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died” to save us “By grace” then “are ye saved through faith.” Grace is the source, faith the condition, of  salvation.. And, first, it is not barely the faith of a heathen..',\n",
       " 'Nor, secondly, is it the faith of a devil, though this goes much farther than that of a heathen.',\n",
       " 'For the devil believes, not only that there is a wise and powerful God, gracious to reward, and just to punish; but also, that Jesus is the Son of God, the Christ, the Saviour of the world.',\n",
       " 'So we find him declaring, in express terms, “I know Thee who Thou art; the Holy One of God” .',\n",
       " 'Thirdly.',\n",
       " 'The faith through which we are saved, in that sense of the word which will hereafter be explained, is not barely that which the Apostles themselves had while Christ was yet upon earth; though they so believed on him as to “leave all and follow him;” although they had then power to work miracles, to “heal all manner of sickness, and all manner of disease;” yea, they had then “power and authority over all devils;” and, which is beyond all this, were sent by  their Master to “preach the kingdom of God.”.',\n",
       " 'What faith is it then through which we are saved?',\n",
       " 'It may be answered, first, in general, it is a faith in Christ: Christ, and God through Christ, are the proper objects of it.',\n",
       " 'herein, therefore, it is sufficiently, absolutely distinguished from the faith either of ancient or modern heathens.',\n",
       " 'And from the faith of a devil it is fully distinguished by this: it is not barely a speculative, rational thing, a cold, lifeless assent, a train of ideas in the head; but also a disposition  of the heart.',\n",
       " 'For thus saith the Scripture, “With the heart man believeth unto righteousness;” and, “If thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thy heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.”.',\n",
       " 'And herein does it differ from that faith which the Apostles themselves had while our Lord was on earth, that it acknowledges the necessity and merit of his death, and the power of his resurrection.',\n",
       " 'It acknowledges his death as the only sufficient means of redeeming man from death eternal, and his resurrection as the restoration of us all to life and immortality; inasmuch as he “was delivered for our sins, and rose again for our justification.” Christian faith is then, not  only an assent to the whole gospel of Christ, but also a full reliance on the blood of Christ; a trust in the merits of his life, death, and resurrection; a recumbency upon him as our atonement and our life, as given for us, and living in us; and, in consequence hereof, a closing with him, and cleaving to him, as our “wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, and redemption,” or, in one word, our salvation.. And, First, whatsoever else it imply, it is a present salvation.',\n",
       " 'It is something attainable, yea, actually attained, on earth, by those who are partakers of this faith.',\n",
       " 'For thus saith the Apostle to the believers at Ephesus, and in them to the believers of all ages, not, Ye shall be though that also is true, but, “Ye are saved through faith.”.',\n",
       " 'Ye are saved to comprise all in one word from sin.',\n",
       " 'This is the salvation which is through faith.',\n",
       " 'This is that great salvation foretold by the angel, before God brought his First-begotten into the world: “Thou shalt call his name Jesus; for he shall save his people from their sins.” And neither here, nor in other parts of holy writ, is there any limitation or restriction.',\n",
       " 'All his people, or, as it is elsewhere expressed, “all that believe in him,” he will save from  all their sins; from original and actual, past and present sin, “of the flesh and of the spirit.” Through faith that is in him, they are saved both from the guilt and from the power of it.. First.',\n",
       " 'From the guilt of all past sin: for, whereas all the world is guilty before God, insomuch that should he “be extreme to mark what is done amiss, there is none that could abide it;” and whereas, “by the law is” only “the knowledge of sin,” but no deliverance from it, so that, “by” fulfilling “the deeds of the law, no flesh can be justified in his sight”: now, “the righteousness of God, which is by faith of Jesus Christ, is manifested unto all that  believe.” Now, “they are justified freely by his grace, through the redemption that is in Jesus Christ.” “Him God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for or by the remission of the sins that are past.” Now hath Christ taken away “the curse of the law, being made a curse for us.” he hath “blotted out the handwriting that was against us, taking it out of the way, nailing it to his cross.” “There is therefore no  condemnation now to them which” believe “in Christ Jesus.”.',\n",
       " 'And being saved from guilt, they are saved from fear.',\n",
       " 'Not indeed from a filial fear of offending; but from all servile fear; from that fear which hath torment; from fear of punishment; from fear of the wrath of God, whom they now no longer regard as a severe Master, but as an indulgent Father.',\n",
       " '“They have not received again the spirit of bondage, but the Spirit of adoption, whereby they cry, Abba, Father: the Spirit itself also bearing witness with their spirits, that they are  the children of God.” They are also saved from the fear, though not from the possibility, of falling away from the grace of God, and coming short of the great and precious promises.',\n",
       " 'Thus have they “peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.',\n",
       " 'They rejoice in hope of the glory of God.',\n",
       " 'And the love of God is shed abroad in their hearts, through the Holy Ghost, which is given unto them.” And hereby they are persuaded though perhaps not at all times, nor with the same fullness of  persuasion, that “neither death, nor life, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate them from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.”.',\n",
       " 'Again: through this faith they are saved from the power of sin, as well as from the guilt of it.',\n",
       " 'So the Apostle declares, “Ye know that he was manifested to take away our sins; and in him is no sin.',\n",
       " 'Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not” .',\n",
       " 'he that is, by faith, born of God sinneth not .',\n",
       " 'by any habitual sin; for all habitual sin is sin reigning: But sin cannot reign in any that believeth.',\n",
       " 'Nor .',\n",
       " 'by any wilful sin: for his will, while he abideth in the faith, is utterly set against all sin, and abhorreth it as deadly poison.',\n",
       " 'Nor .',\n",
       " 'By any sinful desire; for he continually desireth the holy and perfect will of God.',\n",
       " 'and any tendency to an unholy desire, he by the grace of God, stifleth in the birth.',\n",
       " 'Nor .',\n",
       " 'Doth  he sin by infirmities, whether in act, word, or thought; for his infirmities have no concurrence of his will; and without this they are not properly sins.',\n",
       " 'Thus, “he that is born of God doth not commit sin”: and though he cannot say he hath not sinned, yet now “he sinneth not.”.',\n",
       " 'This then is the salvation which is through faith, even in the present world: a salvation from sin, and the consequences of sin, both often expressed in the word justification; which, taken in the largest sense, implies a deliverance from guilt and punishment, by the atonement of Christ actually applied to the soul of the sinner now believing on him, and a deliverance from the power of sin, through Christ formed in his heart.',\n",
       " 'So that he who is thus justified, or  saved by faith, is indeed born again.',\n",
       " 'he is born again of the Spirit unto a new life, which “is hid with Christ in God.” And as a new-born babe he gladly receives the adolon, “sincere milk of the word, and grows thereby;” going on in the might of the Lord his God, from faith to faith, from grace to grace, until at length, he come unto “a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.”.',\n",
       " 'That to preach salvation or justification, by faith only, is to preach against holiness and good works.',\n",
       " 'To which a short answer might be given: “It would be so, if we spake, as some do, of a faith which was separate from these; but we speak of a faith which is not so, but productive of all good works, and all holiness.”.',\n",
       " 'But it may be of use to consider it more at large; especially since it is no new objection, but as old as St. Paul’s time.',\n",
       " 'For even then it was asked, “Do we not make void the law through faith?” We answer, First, all who preach not faith do manifestly make void the law; either directly and grossly, by limitations and comments that eat out all the spirit of the text; or indirectly, by not pointing out the only means whereby it is possible to perform it.',\n",
       " 'Whereas, Secondly,  “we establish the law,” both by showing its full extent and spiritual meaning; and by calling all to that living way, whereby “the righteousness of the law may be fulfilled in them.” These, while they trust in the blood of Christ alone, use all the ordinances which he hath appointed, do all the “good works which he had before prepared that they should walk therein,” and enjoy and manifest all holy and heavenly tempers, even the same mind that was in Christ Jesus..',\n",
       " 'But does not preaching this faith lead men into pride?',\n",
       " 'We answer, Accidentally it may: therefore ought every believer to be earnestly cautioned, in the words of the great Apostle “Because of unbelief,” the first branches “were broken off: and thou standest by faith.',\n",
       " 'Be not high-minded, but fear.',\n",
       " 'If God spared not the natural branches, take heed lest he spare not thee.',\n",
       " 'Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God!',\n",
       " 'On them which fell, severity; but towards thee, goodness,  if thou continue in his goodness; otherwise thou also shalt be cut off.” And while he continues therein, he will remember those words of St. Paul, foreseeing and answering this very objection .',\n",
       " '“However, may not the speaking thus of the mercy of God, as saving or justifying freely by faith only, encourage men in sin?” Indeed, it may and will: Many will “continue in sin that grace may abound:” But their blood is upon their own head.',\n",
       " 'The goodness of God ought to lead them to repentance; and so it will those who are sincere of heart.',\n",
       " 'When they know there is yet forgiveness with him, they will cry aloud that he would blot out their sins also, through faith which is  in Jesus.',\n",
       " 'And if they earnestly cry, and faint not, it they seek him in all the means he hath appointed; if they refuse to be comforted till he come; “he will come, and will not tarry.” And he can do much work in a short time.',\n",
       " 'Many are the examples, in the Acts of the Apostles, of God’s working this faith in men’s hearts, even like lightning falling from heaven.',\n",
       " 'So in the same hour that Paul and Silas began to preach, the jailer repented, believed, and was baptized; as were three  thousand, by St. Peter, on the day of Pentecost, who all repented and believed at his first preaching And, blessed be God, there are now many living proofs that he is still “mighty to save.”.',\n",
       " 'Yet to the same truth, placed in another view, a quite contrary objection is made: “If a man cannot be saved by all that he can do, this will drive men to despair.” True, to despair of being saved by their own works, their own merits, or righteousness.',\n",
       " 'And so it ought; for none can trust in the merits of Christ, till he has utterly renounced his own.',\n",
       " 'he that “goeth about to stablish his own righteousness” cannot receive the righteousness of God.',\n",
       " 'The righteousness which is  of faith cannot be given him while he trusteth in that which is of the law..',\n",
       " 'But this, it is said, is an uncomfortable doctrine.',\n",
       " 'The devil spoke like himself, that is, without either truth or shame, when he dared to suggest to men that it is such.',\n",
       " 'It is the only comfortable one, it is “very full of comfort,” to all self-destroyed, self-condemned sinners.',\n",
       " 'That “whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed that the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him”: here is comfort, high as heaven, stronger than death!',\n",
       " 'What!',\n",
       " 'Mercy for all?',\n",
       " 'For Zacchaeus, a public robber?',\n",

       " 'Methinks I hear one say “Then I, even I, may hope for mercy!” And so thou mayest, thou afflicted one, whom none hath comforted!',\n",
       " 'God will not cast out thy prayer.',\n",
       " 'Nay, perhaps he may say the next hour, “Be of good cheer, thy sins are forgiven thee;” so forgiven, that they shall reign over thee no more; yea, and that “the Holy Spirit shall bear witness with thy spirit that thou art a child of God.” O glad tidings!',\n",
       " 'tidings of great joy, which are sent unto all people!',\n",

       " 'When no more objections occur, then we are simply told that salvation by faith only ought not to be preached as the first doctrine, or, at least, not to be preached at all.',\n",
       " 'But what saith the Holy Ghost?',\n",
       " '“Other foundation can no man lay than that which is laid, even Jesus Christ.” So then, that “whosoever believeth on him shall be saved,” is, and must be, the foundation of all our preaching; that is, must be preached first.',\n",

       "'as the depth of hell from the height of heaven.. For this reason the adversary so rages whenever “salvation by faith” is declared to the world: for this reason did he stir up earth and hell, to destroy those who first preached it.I beseech you, brethren, as in the presence of that God before whom “hell and destruction are without a covering—how much more the hearts of the children of men?”—that each of you would ask his own heart, “Am I of that number?“Hell is paved,” saith one, “with good intentions.” The great question of all, then, still remains.he sleeps on still and takes his rest, though hell is moved from beneath to meet him; though the pit from whence there is no return hath opened its mouth to swallow him up.a sinner satisfied in his sins; contented to remain in his fallen state, to live and die without the image of God; one who is ignorant both of his disease, and of the only remedy for it; one who never was warned, or never regarded the warning voice of God, “to flee from the wrath to come;” one that never yet saw he was in danger of hell-fire, or cried out in the earnestness of  his soul, “What must I do to be saved?”.Now it was that the pillars of hell were shaken, and the kingdom of God spread more and more.How soon did Satan find a seat, even in the temple of God, “till the woman fled into the wilderness,” and “the faithful were again minished from the children of men!” here we tread a beaten path: the still unceasing corruptions of the succeeding generations have been largely  described, from time to time, by those witnesses God raised up, to show that he had “built his church upon a rock, and the gates of hell should not” wholly “prevail against her.” II It is also far easier to take for granted, than to prove from any clear scripture testimony, that justification is the clearing us from the accusation brought against us by the law: At least if this forced, unnatural way of speaking mean either more or less than this, that, whereas we have transgressed the law of God, and thereby deserved the damnation of hell, God does not inflict on those who are justified the punishment which they had deserved..—But here we must take heed that we do not halt with God, through an inconstant, wavering faith: Peter, coming to Christ upon  the water, because he fainted in faith, was in danger of drowning; so we, if we begin to waver or doubt, it is to be feared that we shall sink as Peter did, not into the water, but into the bottomless pit of hell fire.” “Second Sermon on the Passion”.For suppose a sinner of any kind or degree, in a full sense of his total ungodliness, of his utter inability to think, speak, or do good, and his absolute meetness for hell-fire; suppose, I say, this sinner, helpless and hopeless, casts himself wholly on the mercy of God in Christ, which indeed he cannot do but by the grace of God, who can doubt but he is forgiven in that moment?Go as altogether ungodly, guilty, lost, destroyed, deserving and dropping into hell; and thou shalt then find favour in his sight, and know that he justifieth the ungodly.Thou who feelest thou art just fit for hell, art just fit to advance his glory; the glory of his free grace, justifying the ungodly and him that worketh not.“The peace of God,” which God only can give, and the world cannot take away; the peace which “passeth all under-standing,” all barely rational conception; being a supernatural sensation, a divine taste, of “the powers of the world to come;” such as the natural man knoweth not,  how wise soever in the things of this world; nor, indeed, can he know it, in his present state, “because it is spiritually discerned.” It is a peace that banishes all doubt, all painful uncertainty; the Spirit of God bearing witness with the spirit of a Christian, that he is “a child of God.” And it banishes fear, all such fear as hath torment; the fear of the wrath of God; the fear of hell; the fear of the devil; and, in particular, the fear of death: he that hath the peace of God,  desiring, if it were the will of God, “to depart, and to be with Christ.”.This is the sentence, to “be punished” with never-ending death, “with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power.” Knowest thou not that every sinner, enochos estai eis ten geennan tou  pyros, not properly, “is in danger of hell-fire” is far too weak; but rather, “is under the sentence of hell-fire;” doomed already, just dragging to execution.Thou criest out, “My song shall be always of the loving-kindness of the Lord: With my mouth will I ever be telling of thy truth, from one generation to another.” Thou art no longer afraid of hell, or death, or him that had once the power of death, the devil; no, nor painfully afraid of God himself;  only thou hast a tender, filial fear of offending him.O “be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage!” —neither the vile, devilish bondage of sin, of evil desires,  evil tempers, or words, or works, the most grievous yoke on this side hell; nor the bondage of slavish, tormenting fear, of guilt and self-condemnation..But secondly, do all they which abide “in Christ Jesus, walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit?” Then we cannot but infer, that whosoever now committeth sin, hath no part or lot in this matter.If he now hears, “Thou shalt not kill,” God speaks in thunder, “He that hateth his brother is a murderer;”  “he that saith unto his brother, Thou fool, is obnoxious to hell-fire.” If the law say, “Thou shalt not commit adultery,” the voice of the Lord sounds in his ears, “He that looketh on a woman to lust after he hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.” And thus, in every point, he feels the word of God “quick and powerful, sharper than a two-edged sword.” It “pierces even to the dividing asunder of his soul and spirit, his joints and marrow.” And so much the  more, because he is conscious to himself of having neglected so great salvation; of having “trodden under foot the son of God,” who would have saved him from his sins, and “counted the blood of the covenant an unholy,” a common, unsanctifying thing.. And as he knows, “all things are naked and open unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do,” so he sees himself naked, stripped of all the fig-leaves which he had sewed together, of all his poor pretenses to religion or virtue, and his wretched excuses for sinning against God.He feels that “the wages,” the just reward “of sin,” of his sin above all, “is death;” even the second death; the death which dieth not; the destruction of  body and soul in hell..He finds that sin let loose upon the soul whether it be pride, anger, or evil desire, whether self-will, malice, envy, revenge, or any other is perfect misery: He feels sorrow of heart for the blessings he has lost, and the curse which is come upon him: remorse for having thus destroyed himself, and despised his own mercies; fear, from a lively sense of the wrath of God, and of the  consequences of his wrath, of the punishment which he has justly deserved, and which he sees hanging over is head; — fear of death, as being to him the gate of hell, the entrance of death eternal; — fear of the devil, the executioner of the wrath and righteous vengeance of God; — fear of men, who, if they were able to kill his body, would thereby plunge both body and soul into hell; fear, sometimes arising to such a height, that the poor, sinful, guilty soul, is terrified with everything,  with nothing, with shades, with a leaf shaken of the wind.He cannot fear the devil, knowing he has “no power, except it be given him from above.” He fears not hell; being an heir of the kingdom of heaven: Consequently, he has no fear of death; by reason whereof he was in time past, for so many years, “subject to  bondage.” Rather, knowing that “if the earthly house of this tabernacle be dissolved, he hath a building of God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens; he groaneth earnestly, desiring to be clothed upon with that house which is from heaven.” He groans to shake off this house of earth, that “mortality” may be “swallowed up of life;” knowing that God “hath wrought him for the self-same thing; who hath also given him the earnest of his Spirit.”.The first has no light in the things of God, but walks in utter darkness; the second sees the painful light of hell; the third, the joyous light of heaven.Nay, the truth lies between: they still deserve, strictly speaking only the damnation of hell.“hell,” which is here, and indeed in all passages where is the translation of Sheol, or Hades, most misleading to the English reader.“hell,” which is here, and indeed in all passages where is the translation of Sheol, or Hades, most misleading to the English reader.For he “searcheth the reins, and understandeth all our thoughts.” “All things are naked and open to the eyes of him with whom we have to do.” “Hell and destruction are before him without a covering.They were so far from receiving any blessing therein, that they only drew down a curse upon their head; so far from growing more heavenly in heart and life, that they were two-fold more the children of hell than before.Verily, I say unto you, whosoever you are, unto whom any one of the preceding characters belongs, “Ye  are of your father the devil, and the works of your father ye do.” Unto you I call, in the name of Him whom you crucify afresh, and in his words to your circumcised predecessors, “Ye serpents, ye generation of vipers, how can ye escape the damnation of hell?”.To say, then, that ye cannot be born again, that there is no new birth but in baptism, is to seal you all under damnation, to consign you to hell, without help, without hope.Mine and your desert, as well as theirs, is hell; and it is mere mercy, free, undeserved mercy, that we are not now in unquenchable fire.He will not continue to breathe into our soul, unless our soul breathes toward him again; unless our love, and prayer, and thanksgiving return to him, a sacrifice wherewith he is well pleased.. Let us learn, Lastly, to follow that direction of the great Apostle, “Be not high-minded, but fear.” Let us fear sin, more than death or hell.He cannot doubt for a moment, but the least of these deserves the damnation of hell, — “the worm that dieth not, and the fire that never shall be quenched.” Above all, the guilt of “not believing on the  name of the only-begotten Son of God” lies heavy upon him.They see here the house of God eternal in the heavens; there, hell and destruction without a covering; and thence feel the importance of every moment, which just appears, and is gone for ever!.Heaven and hell are in very deed open before you; and ye are on the edge of the great gulf.“Agree with thine adversary quickly;” — now; upon the spot; “whiles thou art in the way with him;” if it be possible, before he go out of thy sight; “lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the judge;” lest he appeal to God, the Judge of all; “and the judge deliver thee to the officer;” to Satan, the executioner of the wrath of God; “and thou be cast into prison;” into hell, there to be  reserved to the judgment of the great day: “Verily, I say unto thee, Thou shalt by no means come out thence, till thou hast paid the uttermost farthing.” But this it is impossible for thee ever to do; seeing thou hast nothing to pay.these Christian  armies, that are sending each by thousands, by ten thousands, quick into hell!devote each other to the nethermost hell!Therefore, “if thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: For it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell:” .In its literal meaning it implies those lovers of God and man who utterly detest and abhor all strife and debate, all variance and contention; and accordingly labour with all their might, either to prevent this fire of hell from being kindled, or, when it is kindled, from breaking out, or, when it is broke out, from spreading any farther.what instruments hath he found, from time to time, to employ in this his service, to wield this grand engine of hell against some of the most important truths of God!When he goes hence, “hell from beneath is moved to meet  him at his coming.” Nor can he sink into the bottomless pit without dragging a multitude after him.. Next to these are the good-natured, good sort of men: who live an easy, harmless life, neither troubling themselves with outward sin, nor with inward holiness; men who are remarkable neither one way nor the other, neither for religion nor irreligion who are very regular both in public and private, but do not pretend to be any stricter than their neighbours.All our desert, we own, is hell: But God loves us freely; therefore, we ask him to give, what we can no more procure for ourselves, than we can merit it at his hands.. “And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive them that trespass against us.” — As nothing but sin can hinder the bounty of God from flowing forth upon every creature, so this petition naturally follows the former; that, all hinderances being removed, we may the more clearly trust in the God of love for every manner of thing which is good.. “As we forgive them that trespass against us.” — In these words our Lord clearly declares both on what condition, and in what degree or manner, we may look to be forgiven of God.You have gained riches, and hell-fire!.O ye rich, how can ye escape the damnation of hell?Let us but open our eyes, and we may daily see the melancholy proofs of this, — men who, desiring, resolving to be rich, coveting after money, the root of all evil, have already pierced themselves through with many sorrows, and anticipated the hell to which they are going!.But if there be a Christian upon earth, if there be a man who hath overcome the world, who desires nothing but God, and fears none but him that is able to destroy both body and soul in hell;  thou, o man of God, speak and spare not; lift up thy voice like a trumpet!So they serve the devil for a morsel of bread; they rush into hell for fear of want; they throw away their poor souls, lest they should, some time or other, fall short of what is needful for their bodies!.Above all,  with what supine carelessness and indifference art thou dancing over the mouth of hell!In these words we may observe, First, the inseparable properties of the way to hell: “Wide is the gate, broad the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be that go in thereat:” Secondly, the inseparable properties of the way to heaven: “Strait is that gate, and few there be that find it:” Thirdly, a serious exhortation grounded thereon, “Enter ye in at the strait gate.” We may observe, First, the inseparable properties of the way to hell: “Wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be that go in thereat.”.For sin is the gate of hell, and wickedness the way to destruction.And how greatly will these saints of the world swell the number of the children of hell!If many go with you, as sure as God is true, both they and you are going to hell!The way to hell has nothing singular in it; but the way to heaven is singularity all over.Such is the folly and madness of mankind, that thousands of men still rush on in the way to hell, only because it is a broad way.— when they who are commissioned to teach men the way to heaven do in fact teach them the way to hell!They are continually peopling the realms of night; and whenever they follow the poor souls whom they have destroyed, “hell shall be moved from beneath to meet them at their coming!”I I may, in the hand of God, snatch many souls from hell, and yet drop into it when I have done.there, hell and  destruction without a covering!On the one hand, the height and depth of the law constrain me to fly to the love of God in Christ; on the other, the love  of God in Christ endears the law to me “above gold or precious stones;” seeing I know every part of it is a gracious promise which my Lord will fulfil in its season.. Who art thou then, O man, that “judgest the law, and speakest evil of the law?” — that rankest it with sin, Satan, and death and sendest them all to hell together?And if thy Lord hath already fulfilled his word, if he hath already “written his law in thy heart,” then “stand fast in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made thee free.” Thou art not only made free from Jewish ceremonies, from the guilt of sin, and the fear of hell these are so far from being the whole, that they are the least and lowest part of Christian liberty; but, what is infinitely more, from the power of sin, from serving the devil, from offending God.“Be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage.” I do not mean of Jewish bondage; nor yet of bondage to the fear of hell: These, I trust, are far from thee.Abhor sin far more than death or hell; abhor sin itself, far more than the punishment of it.It does not answer the very first end of the law, namely, the convincing men of sin; The awakening those who are still asleep on the brink of hell.To preach Christ, is to preach what he hath revealed, either in the Old or New Testament; so that you are really preaching Christ, when you are saying, “The wicked shall be turned into hell, and all the people that forget God,” as when you are saying, “Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world!”.As he is no longer under the ceremonial law, nor under the Mosaic institution; as he is not obliged to keep even the moral law, as the condition of his acceptance; so he is delivered from the wrath and the curse of  God, from all sense of guilt and condemnation, and from all that horror and fear of death and hell whereby he was all his life before subject to bondage.Was not you much in prayer, cold and heavy as you was, while you was hanging over the mouth of hell?He chains their souls down to earth and hell, with the chains of their own vile affections.And by pride, envy, anger, hate, revenge, he causes their souls to draw nigh unto hell; acting the more secure and uncontrolled, because  they know not that he acts at all..Does the love of God constrain thee to serve him with fear, to “rejoice unto him with reverence?” Art thou more afraid of displeasing God, than either of death or hell?Meanwhile, cry continually to God that thou mayest see that prize of thy high calling,  not as Satan represents it, in a horrid dreadful shape, but in its genuine native beauty; not as something that must be, or thou wilt go to hell, but as what may be, to lead thee to heaven.For you will all drop  into the pit together, into the nethermost hell!Even the poor, ungodly poet could tell us, Nemo malus felix: “no wicked man is happy.” The reason is plain: All unholy tempers are uneasy tempers: Not only malice, hatred, envy jealousy, revenge, create a present hell in the breast; but even the softer passions, if not kept  within due bounds, give a thousand times more pain than pleasure.So you utterly block up his way to salvation, and send him to hell, out of mere charity!.Now this is quackery indeed, and that of the worse sort, as it tends, if not to kill men’s bodies, yet without the peculiar mercy of God, “to destroy both their bodies and souls in hell.” It is hard to speak of these “daubers with untempered mortar,” these promise-mongers, as they deserve.And if we freely choose the loss of a limb, rather than the whole body should perish; how much more should we choose,  figuratively, to cut off a right hand, rather than the whole soul should be cast into hell!.None can  gain by swallowing up his neighbour’s substance, without gaining the damnation of hell!.They drive them to hell like sheep.The curse of God is in their gardens, their walks, their groves; a fire that burns to the nethermost hell!Surely both thou and they, when ye are lifting up your eyes in hell, will have  enough both of the “worm that never dieth,” and of “the fire that never shall be quenched!”.But let innocence be joined with prudence, properly so called; — not that offspring of hell which the world calls prudence, which is mere craft, cunning, dissimulation; but with that “wisdom from above” which our Lord peculiarly recommends to all who would promote his kingdom upon earth.The bivalved shell-fish, in particular, seem to have no sense but that of feeling, unless perhaps a low measure of taste; so that they are but one degree above  vegetables.I know not who could thank him for this, unless the devil and his angels: Seeing, on this supposition, all those millions of unhappy  spirits would be plunged into hell by Adam’s sin, without any possible advantage from it.Though they are called Christians, the name does not imply the thing: They are as far from this as hell from heaven!.Are they “holy as He that hath called them is holy?” Are they filled with “righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost?” Is there “that mind in them which was also in Christ Jesus?” And do they “walk as Christ also walked?” Nay, they are as far from it as hell is from heaven!.Let all earth and all hell combine against you; yea, the whole animate and inanimate creation; they cannot harm while God is on your side: His favorable kindness covers you as a shield.. Nearly allied to this confidence in God is the thankfulness we owe for his kind protection.Nevertheless it is certain, that the gates of hell did never totally prevail against it.If I go into the heaven, thou art there: If I  go down to hell, thou art there also.But I say unto you,  Fear him, who after he hath killed hath power to cast into hell; yea, I say unto you, Fear him.” .All the pleasure they ever enjoyed in these is lost, gone, vanished away: For there is no friendship in  hell.But it has been questioned by some, whether there be any fire in hell; that is, any material fire.Nay, our great poet himself supposes the inhabitants of hell to undergo a variety of tortures; not to continue always in the lake of fire, but to be frequently,.The story adds, that when, for his enormous wickedness, he was cast into hell, that foot wherewith he had saved the man’s life was permitted to lie out of  the flames.How then will you bear hell-fire?” Surely it would be torment enough to have the flesh burnt off from only one finger.It is not uncommon to hear even condemned criminals, in our public prisons, say, “O I wish I was hanged out of the way, rather than to be plagued with these wretches that are round about me!” But what are the most abandoned wretches upon earth, compared to the inhabitants of hell?But the inhabitants of hell are perfectly wicked, having no spark of goodness remaining.It gives occasion to offense, to anger and resentment, perhaps in ourselves as well as in our brethren; which, if not presently stopped,  may issue in bitterness, malice, and settled hatred; creating a present hell wherever they are found, as a prelude to hell eternal..Is not sin the greatest evil on this side hell?Shall we go up into heaven, or down into hell, to seek him?And is it not better to go into life having one eye or one hand, than having both to be cast into hell-fire?“Cut off the right hand,” — absolutely renounce the most profitable connexion, — “and cast it from thee.” “It is better for thee to enter into life with one eye,” or one hand, “than having two, to be cast into hell-fire.”.He is not armed either with force or fraud, and is turned out, naked as he is, among thousands that  are armed with the whole armour of Satan, and provided with all the weapons which the prince of this world can supply out of the armory of hell.Indeed what are these, more especially when they are combined with an awakened conscience, but the dogs of hell, already gnawing the soul, forbidding happiness to approach?It is not, “Will you be happy threescore years, and then miserable  forever, or, will you be miserable threescore years, and then happy forever?” It is not, “Will you have first a temporary heaven, and then hell eternal; or, will you have first a temporary hell, and then heaven eternal?” But it is simply this: “Will you be miserable threescore years, and miserable ever after; or, will you be happy threescore years, and happy ever after?Will you have a foretaste of heaven now, and then heaven forever; or will you have a foretaste of hell now and then  hell forever?Will you have two hells, or two heavens?”.They imagine they may live and die in their sins, and nevertheless “escape the damnation of hell.”.And those who are thus given up may be quite stupid, without either fear, or sorrow, or care; utterly easy and unconcerned about God, or heaven, or hell; to which the god of this world contributes not a little, by blinding and hardening their hearts.But, by little and little, he renewed his acquaintance with his old companions, who by degrees wrought upon him, till he dropped all his religion, and was two-fold more a child of hell than before.What would become of you, if you were to die as you are?” “Nay, God forbid,” said Thomas, “for then I should fall into hell headlong!Does that leave any hope to notorious backsliders, that they shall not die eternally; that they can ever recover the favour of God, or escape the damnation of hell?Nay, it is remarkable, that many who had fallen either from justifying or from sanctifying grace, and so deeply fallen that they could hardly be ranked among the servants of God, have been  restored, but seldom till they had been shaken, as it were, over the mouth of hell, and that very frequently in an instant, to all that they had lost.To turn the grace of God into an encouragement to sin is the sure way to the nethermost hell!.But I could not wish them to stop here: I would encourage them to come up higher, without thundering hell and damnation in their ears, without condemning the way wherein they were, telling them it is the way that leads to destruction, I will endeavour to point out to them what is in every respect “a more excellent way.”.Let it be well remembered, I do not affirm that all who do not walk in this way are in the high road to hell.But consider, meantime, that let us have  ever so much faith, and be our faith ever so strong, it will never save us from hell, unless it now save us from all unholy tempers, from pride, passion, impatience; from all arrogance of spirit, all haughtiness and overbearing; from wrath, anger, bitterness; from discontent, murmuring, fretfulness, peevishness.How commonly do we hear it said, “See how zealous the man is!” Nay, he cannot be zealous; that is impossible, for he is in a passion; and passion is as inconsistent with zeal, as light with darkness, or heaven with hell!.And how then shall we be able without which we must drop into hell to “take the kingdom of heaven by violence?” It totally unfits us for “enduring hardship as good soldiers of Jesus Christ;” and, consequently, for “fighting the good fight of faith, and laying hold on eternal life.”.Thou fool, by parity of reason, thou  mayest call hell a good lodging, and the devil a good master.It is real hate; and hate of the most mischievous kind, tending to destroy both body and soul in hell!I dare not receive one as my guide to heaven that is himself on the high road to hell.One cries aloud, “More people go to hell by praying, than by thieving.” Another screams out, “Away with your works!which is no less, in effect, than to affirm, that all the children of Israel went to hell for eleven or twelve hundred years together!.For can this “faith save him?” Can it save any man either from sin or from hell?It is true, this is not the nethermost hell: they are not to be tormented there “before the time;” before the end of the world, when everyone will receive his just recompense of reward.They carry with them their own hell, in the worm that never dieth; in a consciousness of guilt, and of the wrath of God, which continually drinks up their spirits; in diabolical, infernal tempers, which are essential misery; and in what they cannot shake off, no, not for an hour, any more than they can shake off their own being, — that “fearful  looking for of fiery indignation, which will devour God’s adversaries.”.Moreover, faith opens another scene in the eternal world; namely, the coming of our Lord in the clouds of heaven to “judge both the quick and the dead.” It enables us to see the “great white throne coming down from heaven, and Him that sitteth thereon, from whose face the heavens and the earth flee away, and there is found no place for them.” We see “the dead, small and great, stand before God.” We see “the books opened, and the dead judged, according to the things  that are written in the books.” We see the earth and the sea giving up their dead, and hell that is, the invisible world“giving up the dead that were therein, and everyone judged according to his works.. By faith we are also shown the immediate consequences of the general judgment.This comfortable truth, that “God filleth heaven and earth,” we learn also from the Psalm above recited: “If I climb up into heaven, thou art there; if I go down to hell, thou art there also.In particular, it is hard to conceive, how a person in hell could hold conversation with one in paradise.And in hell he lifted up his eyes.” — O, what a change!But the word which is here rendered hell does not always mean the place of the damned.as far as from hell to paradise!No mercy can enter within the shades of hell!.“But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things; but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented.” Perhaps these words may supply us with an answer to an important question: How came this rich man to be in hell?Ye are every moment on the verge of hell!Let all of them, therefore, beware how they follow his example who is “lifting up his eyes in hell!” Let us follow the advice of the Apostle, being “adorned with good works, and with the  ornament of a meek and quiet spirit.”.If a soul in hell knew Lazarus in paradise, as far off as he was, certainly those that are together in paradise will perfectly know each other.. “And he cried, and said, Father Abraham, have mercy upon me!” — I do not remember, in all the Bible, any prayer made to a saint, but this.And if we observe who made it, — a man in hell, — and with what success, we shall hardly wish to follow the precedent.When the question is concerning marrying your daughter, if you consider her body more than her soul, take knowledge of yourself: You are in the way to hell, and not to heaven; for you walk by sight, and not by faith.But those who suppose it to be religion are given up to a strong delusion to believe a lie, and if they suppose it to be a sure passport to heaven are in the high road to hell.Observe well: Religion is not harmlessness; which a careful observer of mankind  properly terms hellish harmlessness, as it sends thousands to the bottomless pit.It  is a total studied inattention to the whole invisible and eternal world; more especially to death, the gate of eternity, and to the important consequences of death, — heaven and hell!.It is one of the choicest instruments of destroying immortal spirits that was ever forged in the magazines of hell.And yet nothing can be more plain, than that all who observe the two first rules without the third, will be  twofold more the children of hell than ever they were before.. O that God would enable me once more, before I go hence and am no more seen, to lift up my voice like a trumpet to those who gain and save all they can, but do not give all they can!Then if you have any desire to escape the damnation of hell, give all you can;  otherwise I can have no more hope of your salvation, than of that of Judas Iscariot..They do not desire or think of heaven; therefore, they sink deep as hell.. For this reason they are as far from real holiness as they are from valuable knowledge.do not you prefer his being a cobbler on earth, and a glorious saint in heaven, before his being a lord on earth, and a damned spirit in hell?The more the worse; the less probability will she have of escaping the damnation of hell.They have sunk both me and thee into hell!”.Death and hell are hid beneath.Such as these were they who made St. Chrysostom to say, “Hell is paved with the souls of Christian Priests.”.What a laughing-stock unless she severely repent will she be to all the devils in hell, when her wealthy companion has dragged her down to his own place of torment!.Though  he was not terrified with anything on earth, he would be at the very gates of hell.Indeed, two hundred years ago, it was tolerably expressed by the word hell, which then signified  much the same with the word hades, namely, the invisible world.Accordingly, by Christ descending into hell, they meant, his body remained in the grave, his soul remained in hades, which is the receptacle of separate spirits, from death to the resurrection.One said, ‘I have set a house on fire, and destroyed all its inhabitants.’ Another said, ‘I have raised a storm at sea, and sunk a ship; and all on board perished in the waters.’ Satan answered, ‘Perhaps those that were burnt or drowned were saved.’ A third said, ‘I have been forty years tempting a holy man to commit adultery; and I have left him asleep in his sin.’ Hearing this, Satan  rose to do him honour; and all hell resounded with his praise.” Hear this, all ye that imagine you cannot fall from grace!.This affording to rob God is the very cant of hell.where there is no difference of opinions; but all think alike; all are of one heart, and of one mind: Where that offspring of hell, controversy, which turneth this world upside down, can never come: Where those who have been sawn asunder thereby, and often cried out in the bitterness of their soul, “Peace, peace!” shall find what they then sought in vain, even a peace which none taketh  from them.. And yet all this, inconceivably great as it is, is the least part of their deliverance.Accordingly, they are born for this, — to be  destroyed body and soul in hell.I do not say, none who hold it are holy; for God is of tender mercy to those who are unavoidably entangled in errors of any kind; but that the doctrine itself, — that every man is either elected or  not elected from eternity, and that the one must inevitably be saved, and the other inevitably damned, — has a manifest tendency to destroy holiness in general; for it wholly takes away those first motives to follow after it, so frequently proposed in Scripture, the hope of future reward and fear of punishment, the hope of heaven and fear of hell.Thou, with all thy principalities and powers, canst only so assault that we may resist thee; but He can irresistibly destroy both body and soul in hell!Hearest thou not that God is the devouring lion, the destroyer of souls, the murderer of men” Moloch caused only children to pass though the fire: and that fire was soon quenched; or, the corruptible body being consumed, its torment was at an end; but God, thou are told, by his eternal decree, fixed before they had done good or evil, causes, not only children of a span long, but the parents also, to pass through the fire of hell, the  ‘fire which never shall be quenched; and the body which is cast thereinto, being now incorruptible and immortal, will be ever consuming and never consumed, but ‘the smoke of their torment,’ because it is God’s good pleasure, ‘ascendeth up for ever and ever.’”.He is there, Down to hell?Sing, O hell, and rejoice, ye that are under the earth!Let all the sons of hell shout for joy!Fear God, even that God can in a moment cast both body and soul into hell!So that if any  fell into lukewarmness, or even into sin, he had none to lift him up: He might fall lower and lower, yea, into hell, if he would, for who regarded it?.There are those who expound the oracles of God by the same Spirit wherewith they were written; and who faithfully cleave to the solid foundation which our Church hath laid agreeable thereto; touching which we have His word who cannot lie, that “the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.” There are those also, blessed be the Author of every good gift!'"

       "'as the depth of hell from the height of heaven.. For this reason the adversary so rages whenever “salvation by faith” is declared to the world: for this reason did he stir up earth and hell, to destroy those who first preached it. I beseech you, brethren, as in the presence of that God before whom “hell and destruction are without a covering—how much more the hearts of the children of men?”—that each of you would ask his own heart, “Am I of that number?“Hell is paved,” saith one, “with good intentions.” Now it was that the pillars of hell were shaken, and the kingdom of God spread more and more. Then we cannot but infer, that whosoever now committeth sin, hath no part or lot in this matter. Nay, the truth lies between: they still deserve, strictly speaking only the damnation of hell. They were so far from receiving any blessing therein, that they only drew down a curse upon their head; so far from growing more heavenly in heart and life, that they were two-fold more the children of hell than before. Unto you I call, in the name of Him whom you crucify afresh, and in his words to your circumcised predecessors, “Ye serpents, ye generation of vipers, how can ye escape the damnation of hell?”. Mine and your desert, as well as theirs, is hell; and it is mere mercy, free, undeserved mercy, that we are not now in unquenchable fire. All our desert, we own, is hell: But God loves us freely; therefore, we ask him to give, what we can no more procure for ourselves, than we can merit it at his hands.. “And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive them that trespass against us.” — For sin is the gate of hell, and wickedness the way to destruction. And if we freely choose the loss of a limb, rather than the whole body should perish; how much more should we choose,  figuratively, to cut off a right hand, rather than the whole soul should be cast into hell!.None can  gain by swallowing up his neighbour’s substance, without gaining the damnation of hell!.They drive them to hell like sheep. The bivalved shell-fish, in particular, seem to have no sense but that of feeling, unless perhaps a low measure of taste; so that they are but one degree above  vegetables. Nevertheless it is certain, that the gates of hell did never totally prevail against it. If I go into the heaven, thou art there: If I  go down to hell, thou art there also. .All the pleasure they ever enjoyed in these is lost, gone, vanished away: For there is no friendship in  hell. Surely it would be torment enough to have the flesh burnt off from only one finger. And those who are thus given up may be quite stupid, without either fear, or sorrow, or care; utterly easy and unconcerned about God, or heaven, or hell; to which the god of this world contributes not a little, by blinding and hardening their hearts. But, by little and little, he renewed his acquaintance with his old companions, who by degrees wrought upon him, till he dropped all his religion, and was two-fold more a child of hell than before. Nay, God forbid,” said Thomas, “for then I should fall into hell headlong!Does that leave any hope to notorious backsliders, that they shall not die eternally; that they can ever recover the favour of God, or escape the damnation of hell?Nay, it is remarkable, that many who had fallen either from justifying or from sanctifying grace, and so deeply fallen that they could hardly be ranked among the servants of God, have been  restored, but seldom till they had been shaken, as it were, over the mouth of hell, and that very frequently in an instant, to all that they had lost. They carry with them their own hell, in the worm that never dieth; in a consciousness of guilt, and of the wrath of God, which continually drinks up their spirits; in diabolical, infernal tempers, which are essential misery; and in what they cannot shake off, no, not for an hour, any more than they can shake off their own being, — that “fearful  looking for of fiery indignation, which will devour God’s adversaries.”. Observe well: Religion is not harmlessness; which a careful observer of mankind  properly terms hellish harmlessness, as it sends thousands to the bottomless pit. Indeed, two hundred years ago, it was tolerably expressed by the word hell, which then signified  much the same with the word hades, namely, the invisible world. Accordingly, by Christ descending into hell, they meant, his body remained in the grave, his soul remained in hades, which is the receptacle of separate spirits, from death to the resurrection. One said, ‘I have set a house on fire, and destroyed all its inhabitants.’ shall find what they then sought in vain, even a peace which none taketh  from them.. And yet all this, inconceivably great as it is, is the least part of their deliverance. Accordingly, they are born for this, — to be  destroyed body and soul in hell. There are those also, blessed be the Author of every good gift!'"
