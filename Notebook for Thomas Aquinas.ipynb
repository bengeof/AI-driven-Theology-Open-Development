       "[\"I answer that, It was necessary for man's salvation that there should be a knowledge revealed by God besides philosophical science built up by human reason.\",\n",
       " 'Firstly, indeed, because man is directed to God, as to an end that surpasses the grasp of his reason: \"The eye hath not seen, O God, besides Thee, what things Thou hast prepared for them that wait for Thee\" I answer that, Sacred doctrine is a science.',\n",
       " 'We must bear in mind that there are two kinds of sciences.',\n",
       " 'There are some which proceed from a principle known by the natural light of intelligence, such as arithmetic and geometry and the like.',\n",
       " 'There are some which proceed from principles known by the light of a higher science: thus the science of perspective proceeds from principles established by geometry, and music from principles established by arithmetic.',\n",
       " 'So it is that   sacred doctrine is a science because it proceeds from principles established by the light of a higher science, namely, the science of God and the blessed.',\n",
       " 'Hence, just as the musician accepts on authority the principles taught him by the mathematician, so sacred science is established on principles revealed by God.I answer that, Sacred doctrine is one science.',\n",
       " 'The unity of a faculty or habit is to be gauged by its object, not indeed, in its material aspect, but as regards the precise formality under which it is an object.',\n",
       " 'For example, man, ass, stone agree in the one precise formality of being colored; and color is the formal object of sight.',\n",
       " 'Therefore, because Sacred Scripture considers things precisely under the formality of being divinely revealed, whatever has been divinely   revealed possesses the one precise formality of the object of this science; and therefore is included under sacred doctrine as under one science.I answer that, Sacred doctrine, being one, extends to things which belong to different philosophical sciences because it considers in each the same formal aspect, namely, so far as they can be known through divine revelation.',\n",
       " 'Hence, although among the philosophical sciences one is speculative and another practical, nevertheless sacred doctrine includes both; as God, by one and the same science, knows both Himself and His works.',\n",
       " 'Still, it is speculative rather than   practical because it is more concerned with divine things than with human acts; though it does treat even of these latter, inasmuch as man is ordained by them to the perfect knowledge of God in which consists eternal bliss.',\n",
       " 'This is a sufficient answer to the Objections.I answer that, Since this science is partly speculative and partly practical, it transcends all others speculative and practical.',\n",
       " 'Now one speculative science is said to be nobler than another, either by reason of its greater certitude, or by reason of the higher worth of its subject-matter.',\n",
       " \"In both these respects this science surpasses other speculative sciences; in point of greater certitude, because other sciences derive their certitude from the natural light of human   reason, which can err; whereas this derives its certitude from the light of divine knowledge, which cannot be misled: in point of the higher worth of its subject-matter because this science treats chiefly of those things which by their sublimity transcend human reason; while other sciences consider only those things which are within reason's grasp.\",\n",
       " 'Of the practical sciences, that one is nobler which is ordained to a further purpose, as political science is nobler than military science; for the   good of the army is directed to the good of the State.',\n",
       " 'But the purpose of this science, in so far as it is practical, is eternal bliss; to which as to an ultimate end the purposes of every practical science are directed.',\n",
       " 'Hence it is clear that from every standpoint, it is nobler than other sciences.I answer that, This doctrine is wisdom above all human wisdom; not merely in any one order, but absolutely.',\n",
       " 'For since it is the part of a wise man to arrange and to judge, and since lesser matters should be judged in the light of some higher principle, he is said to be wise in any one order who considers the highest principle in that order: thus in the order of building, he who plans the form of the house is called wise and architect, in opposition to the inferior laborers   who trim the wood and make ready the stones: \"As a wise architect, I have laid the foundation\" I answer that, God is the object of this science.',\n",
       " 'The relation between a science and its object is the same as that between a habit or faculty and its object.',\n",
       " 'Now properly speaking, the object of a faculty or habit is the thing under the aspect of which all things are referred to that faculty or habit, as man and stone are referred to the faculty of sight in that they are colored.',\n",
       " 'Hence colored things are the proper objects of sight.',\n",
       " 'But in sacred science, all things are   treated of under the aspect of God: either because they are God Himself or because they refer to God as their beginning and end.',\n",
       " 'Hence it follows that God is in very truth the object of this science.',\n",
       " 'This is clear also from the principles of this science, namely, the articles of faith, for faith is about God.',\n",
       " 'The object of the principles and of the whole science must be the same, since the whole science is contained virtually in its principles.',\n",
       " 'Some, however, looking to what is treated of in   this science, and not to the aspect under which it is treated, have asserted the object of this science to be something other than God---that is, either things and signs; or the works of salvation; or the whole Christ, as the head and members.',\n",
       " 'Of all these things, in truth, we treat in this science, but so far as they have reference to God.I answer that, As other sciences do not argue in proof of their principles, but argue from their principles to demonstrate other truths in these sciences: so this doctrine does not argue in proof of its principles, which are the articles of faith, but from them it goes on to prove something else; as the Apostle from the resurrection of Christ argues in proof of the general resurrection I answer that, It is befitting Holy Writ to put forward divine and spiritual truths by means of comparisons with material things.',\n",
       " 'For God provides for everything according to the capacity of its nature.',\n",
       " 'Now it is natural to man to attain to intellectual truths through sensible objects, because all our knowledge originates from sense.',\n",
       " 'Hence in Holy Writ, spiritual truths are fittingly taught under the likeness of material things.',\n",
       " 'This is what Dionysius says Coel.',\n",
       " 'Hier.',\n",
       " 'i:   \"We cannot be enlightened by the divine rays except they be hidden within the covering of many sacred veils.\"',\n",
       " 'It is also befitting Holy Writ, which is proposed to all without distinction of persons---\"To the wise and to the unwise I am a debtor\" I answer that, The author of Holy Writ is God, in whose power it is to signify His meaning, not by words only as man also can do, but also by things themselves.',\n",
       " 'So, whereas in every other science things are signified by words, this science has the property, that the things signified by the words have themselves also a signification.',\n",
       " 'Therefore that first signification whereby words signify things belongs to the first sense, the historical or literal.',\n",
       " 'That signification   whereby things signified by words have themselves also a signification is called the spiritual sense, which is based on the literal, and presupposes it.',\n",
       " 'Now this spiritual sense has a threefold division.',\n",
       " 'For as the Apostle says I answer that, A thing can be self-evident in either of two ways: on the one hand, self-evident in itself, though not to us; on the other, self-evident in itself, and to us.',\n",
       " 'A proposition is self-evident because the predicate is included in the essence of the subject, as \"Man is an animal,\" for animal is contained in the essence of man.',\n",
       " 'If, therefore the essence of the predicate and subject be known to all, the proposition will be self-evident to all; as is clear with   regard to the first principles of demonstration, the terms of which are common things that no one is ignorant of, such as being and non-being, whole and part, and such like.',\n",
       " 'If, however, there are some to whom the essence of the predicate and subject is unknown, the proposition will be self-evident in itself, but not to those who do not know the meaning of the predicate and subject of the proposition.',\n",
       " 'Therefore, it happens, as Boethius says Hebdom., the title of which is: \"Whether all that is,   is good\", \"that there are some mental concepts self-evident only to the learned, as that incorporeal substances are not in space.\"',\n",
       " 'Therefore I say that this proposition, \"God exists,\" of itself is self-evident, for the predicate is the same as the subject, because God is His own existence as will be hereafter shown Q[], A[].',\n",
       " 'Now because we do not know the essence of God, the proposition is not self-evident to us; but needs to be demonstrated by things that are more   known to us, though less known in their nature---namely, by effects.I answer that, Demonstration can be made in two ways: One is through the cause, and is called \"a priori,\" and this is to argue from what is prior absolutely.',\n",
       " 'The other is through the effect, and is called a demonstration \"a posteriori\"; this is to argue from what is prior relatively only to us.',\n",
       " 'When an effect is better known to us than its cause, from the effect we proceed to the knowledge of the cause.',\n",
       " 'And from every effect the existence of its proper cause can be   demonstrated, so long as its effects are better known to us; because since every effect depends upon its cause, if the effect exists, the cause must pre-exist.',\n",
       " 'Hence the existence of God, in so far as it is not self-evident to us, can be demonstrated from those of His effects which are known to us.I answer that, The existence of God can be proved in five ways.I answer that, It is absolutely true that God is not a body; and this can be shown in three ways.',\n",
       " 'First, because no body is in motion unless it be put in motion, as is evident from induction.',\n",
       " 'Now it has been already proved Q[], A[], that God is the First Mover, and is Himself unmoved.',\n",
       " 'Therefore it is clear that God is not a body.',\n",
       " 'Secondly, because the first being must of necessity be in act, and in no way in potentiality.',\n",
       " 'For although in any   single thing that passes from potentiality to actuality, the potentiality is prior in time to the actuality; nevertheless, absolutely speaking, actuality is prior to potentiality; for whatever is in potentiality can be reduced into actuality only by some being in actuality.',\n",
       " 'Now it has been already proved that God is the First Being.',\n",
       " 'It is therefore impossible that in God there should be any potentiality.',\n",
       " 'But every body is in potentiality because the continuous, as such, is divisible to   infinity; it is therefore impossible that God should be a body.',\n",
       " 'Thirdly, because God is the most noble of beings.',\n",
       " 'Now it is impossible for a body to be the most noble of beings; for a body must be either animate or inanimate; and an animate body is manifestly nobler than any inanimate body.',\n",
       " 'But an animate body is not animate precisely as body; otherwise all bodies would be animate.',\n",
       " 'Therefore its animation depends upon some other thing, as our body depends for its animation on the soul.',\n",
       " 'Hence   that by which a body becomes animated must be nobler than the body.',\n",
       " 'Therefore it is impossible that God should be a body.I answer that, It is impossible that matter should exist in God.',\n",
       " 'First, because matter is in potentiality.',\n",
       " 'But we have shown Q[], A[] that God is pure act, without any potentiality.',\n",
       " 'Hence it is impossible that God should be composed of matter and form.',\n",
       " 'Secondly, because everything composed of matter and form owes its perfection and goodness to its form; therefore its goodness is participated, inasmuch as matter participates the form.',\n",
       " 'Now the   first good and the best---viz.',\n",
       " 'God---is not a participated good, because the essential good is prior to the participated good.',\n",
       " 'Hence it is impossible that God should be composed of matter and form.',\n",
       " 'Thirdly, because every agent acts by its form; hence the manner in which it has its form is the manner in which it is an agent.',\n",
       " 'Therefore whatever is primarily and essentially an agent must be primarily and essentially form.',\n",
       " 'Now God is the first agent, since He is the first efficient cause.',\n",
       " 'He is   therefore of His essence a form; and not composed of matter and form.I answer that, God is the same as His essence or nature.',\n",
       " 'To understand this, it must be noted that in things composed of matter and form, the nature or essence must differ from the \"suppositum,\" because the essence or nature connotes only what is included in the definition of the species; as, humanity connotes all that is included in the definition of man, for it is by this that man is man, and it is this that humanity signifies, that, namely, whereby man is man.',\n",
       " 'Now   individual matter, with all the individualizing accidents, is not included in the definition of the species.',\n",
       " 'For this particular flesh, these bones, this blackness or whiteness, etc., are not included in the definition of a man.',\n",
       " 'Therefore this flesh, these bones, and the accidental qualities distinguishing this particular matter, are not included in humanity; and yet they are included in the thing which is man.',\n",
       " 'Hence the thing which is a man has something more in it than has humanity.',\n",
       " 'Consequently humanity and a man are not wholly identical; but humanity is taken to mean the formal part of a man, because the principles whereby a thing is defined are regarded as the formal constituent in regard to the individualizing matter.',\n",
       " 'On the other hand, in things not composed of matter and form, in which individualization is not due to individual matter---that is to say, to \"this\" matter---the very forms being individualized of themselves---it is necessary the forms themselves should   be subsisting \"supposita.\"',\n",
       " 'Therefore \"suppositum\" and nature in them are identified.',\n",
       " 'Since God then is not composed of matter and form, He must be His own Godhead, His own Life, and whatever else is thus predicated of Him.I answer that, God is not only His own essence, as shown in the preceding article, but also His own existence.',\n",
       " 'This may be shown in several ways.',\n",
       " 'First, whatever a thing has besides its essence must be caused either by the constituent principles of that essence like a property that necessarily accompanies the species---as the faculty of laughing is proper to a man---and is caused by the constituent principles of the species, or by some exterior agent---as heat is caused   in water by fire.',\n",
       " 'Therefore, if the existence of a thing differs from its essence, this existence must be caused either by some exterior agent or by its essential principles.',\n",
       " \"Now it is impossible for a thing's existence to be caused by its essential constituent principles, for nothing can be the sufficient cause of its own existence, if its existence is caused.\",\n",
       " 'Therefore that thing, whose existence differs from its essence, must have its existence caused by another.',\n",
       " 'But this cannot be true of   God; because we call God the first efficient cause.',\n",
       " 'Therefore it is impossible that in God His existence should differ from His essence.',\n",
       " 'Secondly, existence is that which makes every form or nature actual; for goodness and humanity are spoken of as actual, only because they are spoken of as existing.',\n",
       " 'Therefore existence must be compared to essence, if the latter is a distinct reality, as actuality to potentiality.',\n",
       " 'Therefore, since in God there is no potentiality, as shown above   A[], it follows that in Him essence does not differ from existence.',\n",
       " 'Therefore His essence is His existence.',\n",
       " 'Thirdly, because, just as that which has fire, but is not itself fire, is on fire by participation; so that which has existence but is not existence, is a being by participation.',\n",
       " 'But God is His own essence, as shown above A[] if, therefore, He is not His own existence He will be not essential, but participated being.',\n",
       " 'He will not   therefore be the first being---which is absurd.',\n",
       " 'Therefore God is His own existence, and not merely His own essence.I answer that, A thing can be in a genus in two ways; either absolutely and properly, as a species contained under a genus; or as being reducible to it, as principles and privations.',\n",
       " 'For example, a point and unity are reduced to the genus of quantity, as its principles; while blindness and all other privations are reduced to the genus of habit.',\n",
       " 'But in neither way is God in a genus.',\n",
       " 'That He cannot be a species of any genus may be shown in three ways.',\n",
       " 'First, because a   species is constituted of genus and difference.',\n",
       " 'Now that from which the difference constituting the species is derived, is always related to that from which the genus is derived, as actuality is related to potentiality.',\n",
       " 'For animal is derived from sensitive nature, by concretion as it were, for that is animal, which has a sensitive nature.',\n",
       " 'Rational being, on the other hand, is derived from intellectual nature, because that is rational, which has an intellectual nature, and intelligence is   compared to sense, as actuality is to potentiality.',\n",
       " 'The same argument holds good in other things.',\n",
       " 'Hence since in God actuality is not added to potentiality, it is impossible that He should be in any genus as a species.',\n",
       " 'Secondly, since the existence of God is His essence, if God were in any genus, He would be the genus \"being\", because, since genus is predicated as an essential it refers to the essence of a thing.',\n",
       " 'But the Philosopher has shown Metaph.',\n",
       " 'iii that being cannot be a genus, for   every genus has differences distinct from its generic essence.',\n",
       " 'Now no difference can exist distinct from being; for non-being cannot be a difference.',\n",
       " 'It follows then that God is not in a genus.',\n",
       " 'Thirdly, because all in one genus agree in the quiddity or essence of the genus which is predicated of them as an essential, but they differ in their existence.',\n",
       " 'For the existence of man and of horse is not the same; as also of this man and that man: thus in every member of a genus, existence and   quiddity---i.e.',\n",
       " 'essence---must differ.',\n",
       " 'But in God they do not differ, as shown in the preceding article.',\n",
       " 'Therefore it is plain that God is not in a genus as if He were a species.',\n",
       " 'From this it is also plain that He has no genus nor difference, nor can there be any definition of Him; nor, save through His effects, a demonstration of Him: for a definition is from genus and difference; and the mean of a demonstration is a definition.',\n",
       " 'That God is not in a genus, as reducible to it as its principle,   is clear from this, that a principle reducible to any genus does not extend beyond that genus; as, a point is the principle of continuous quantity alone; and unity, of discontinuous quantity.',\n",
       " 'But God is the principle of all being.',\n",
       " 'Therefore He is not contained in any genus as its principle.I answer that, From all we have said, it is clear there can be no accident in God.',\n",
       " 'First, because a subject is compared to its accidents as potentiality to actuality; for a subject is in some sense made actual by its accidents.',\n",
       " 'But there can be no potentiality in God, as was shown Q[], A[].',\n",
       " 'Secondly, because God is His own existence; and as Boethius says Hebdom.',\n",
       " ', although every essence may have something superadded to it, this cannot apply to   absolute being: thus a heated substance can have something extraneous to heat added to it, as whiteness, nevertheless absolute heat can have nothing else than heat.',\n",
       " 'Thirdly, because what is essential is prior to what is accidental.',\n",
       " 'Whence as God is absolute primal being, there can be in Him nothing accidental.',\n",
       " 'Neither can He have any essential accidents as the capability of laughing is an essential accident of man, because such accidents are caused by the constituent principles of the   subject.',\n",
       " 'Now there can be nothing caused in God, since He is the first cause.',\n",
       " 'Hence it follows that there is no accident in God.I answer that, The absolute simplicity of God may be shown in many ways.',\n",
       " 'First, from the previous articles of this question.',\n",
       " 'For there is neither composition of quantitative parts in God, since He is not a body; nor composition of matter and form; nor does His nature differ from His \"suppositum\"; nor His essence from His existence; neither is there in Him composition of genus and difference, nor of subject and accident.',\n",
       " 'Therefore, it is clear that God is nowise composite,   but is altogether simple.',\n",
       " 'Secondly, because every composite is posterior to its component parts, and is dependent on them; but God is the first being, as shown above Q[], A[].',\n",
       " 'Thirdly, because every composite has a cause, for things in themselves different cannot unite unless something causes them to unite.',\n",
       " 'But God is uncaused, as shown above Q[], A[], since He is the first efficient cause.',\n",
       " 'Fourthly, because in every composite there must   be potentiality and actuality; but this does not apply to God; for either one of the parts actuates another, or at least all the parts are potential to the whole.',\n",
       " 'Fifthly, because nothing composite can be predicated of any single one of its parts.',\n",
       " 'And this is evident in a whole made up of dissimilar parts; for no part of a man is a man, nor any of the parts of the foot, a foot.',\n",
       " 'But in wholes made up of similar parts, although something which is predicated of the whole may be predicated of a   part as a part of the air is air, and a part of water, water, nevertheless certain things are predicable of the whole which cannot be predicated of any of the parts; for instance, if the whole volume of water is two cubits, no part of it can be two cubits.',\n",
       " 'Thus in every composite there is something which is not it itself.',\n",
       " 'But, even if this could be said of whatever has a form, viz.',\n",
       " 'that it has something which is not it itself, as in a white object there is something which does not belong to   the essence of white; nevertheless in the form itself, there is nothing besides itself.',\n",
       " 'And so, since God is absolute form, or rather absolute being, He can be in no way composite.',\n",
       " 'Hilary implies this argument, when he says De Trin.',\n",
       " 'vii: \"God, Who is strength, is not made up of things that are weak; nor is He Who is light, composed of things that are dim.',\n",

       "'Therefore, because Sacred Scripture considers things precisely under the formality of being divinely revealed, whatever has been divinely   revealed possesses the one precise formality of the object of this science; and therefore is included under sacred doctrine as under one science.I answer that, Sacred doctrine, being one, extends to things which belong to different philosophical sciences because it considers in each the same formal aspect, namely, so far as they can be known through divine revelation.But against this opinion are all the warnings of Holy Scripture, exhorting us to prayer and other good works.I answer that, The book of life is in God taken in a metaphorical sense, according to a comparison with human affairs.For it is customary in the Scriptures to say that something is done when it becomes known.iii, , He possesses joy in Himself and all things else for His delight; instead of riches He has that complete self-sufficiency, which is promised by riches; in place of power, He has omnipotence; for dignities, the government of all things; and in place of fame, He possesses the admiration of all creatures.I answer that, Divine Scripture uses, in relation to God, names which signify procession.A thing is of faith, indirectly, if the denial of it involves as a consequence something against faith; as for instance if anyone said that Samuel was not the son of Elcana,   for it follows that the divine Scripture would be false.For it is not found in the canonical Scripture except as applied to the Son; as in the words, \"Who is the Image of the invisible God, the firstborn of creatures\" I answer that, While there are two processions in God, one of these, the procession of love, has no proper name of its own, as stated above Q[] , A[], ad .Consequently not all intellectual substances are united to bodies; but some are quite separated from bodies, and these we call angels.I answer that, Some have maintained that the angels never assume bodies, but that all that we read in Scripture of apparitions of angels happened in prophetic vision---that is, according to imagination.But this is contrary to the intent of Scripture; for whatever is beheld in imaginary vision is only in the beholder\\'s imagination, and consequently is not seen by everybody.Yet Divine Scripture from time to time introduces angels so apparent as to be seen commonly by all;   just as the angels who appeared to Abraham were seen by him and by his whole family, by Lot, and by the citizens of Sodom; in like manner the angel who appeared to Tobias was seen by all present.Since this opinion, however, is in contradiction with the   authority of Scripture---for it is said of the devil under the figure of the prince of Babylon I answer that, There is a twofold opinion on this point.It is also contrary to the authority of Sacred Scripture, which declares that   demons and wicked men shall be sent \"into everlasting punishment,\" and the good brought \"into everlasting life.\"In the first place, because it is contrary to Scripture, which, after narrating the production of each kind of corporeal creatures, subjoins, \"God saw that it was good\" I answer that, Some have maintained that creatures proceeded from God by degrees, in such a way that the first creature proceeded from Him immediately, and in its turn produced another, and so on until the production of corporeal creatures.The first is, to hold the truth of Scripture without wavering.The second is that since Holy Scripture can be explained in a multiplicity of senses, one should adhere to a particular explanation, only in such measure as to be ready to abandon it, if it be proved with certainty to be false; lest Holy Scripture be exposed to the ridicule of unbelievers,   and obstacles be placed to their believing.I answer that, The text of Genesis, considered superficially, might lead to the adoption of a theory similar to that held by certain philosophers of antiquity, who taught that water was a body infinite in dimension, and the primary element of all bodies.He supports this view by the authority of Scripture, for it is said I answer that, In recapitulating the Divine works, Scripture says Q[], A[], that three things are recorded as created, namely, the heaven, the water, and the earth; and these three received their form from the three days\\' work of distinction, so that heaven was formed on the first day; on the second day the waters were   separated; and on the third day, the earth was divided into sea and dry land.Wherefore Scripture does not say: \"Let the firmament produce lights,\" though it says: \"Let the earth bring forth the green herb.\"I answer that, It was necessary for woman to be made, as the Scripture says, as a \"helper\" to man; not, indeed, as a helpmate in other works, as some say, since man can be more efficiently helped by another man in other works; but as a helper in the work of generation.For whatever Scripture tells us about paradise is set down as matter of history; and wherever Scripture makes use of this method, we must hold to the historical truth of the narrative as a foundation of whatever spiritual explanation we may offer.Accordingly if by a hypocrite we mean a person whose intention is directed to both the above, one, namely, who cares not to be holy but only to appear so, in which sense Sacred Scripture is wont to use the term, it is evident that hypocrisy is a mortal sin: for no one is entirely deprived of holiness save through mortal sin.Now it belongs to religion to give worship to God: and just as the Divine scriptures teach the interior worship under the guise of certain corporal similitudes, so is external worship given to God under the guise of   sensible signs.i,  the abbot Moses says: \"Fastings, watchings, meditating on the Scriptures, poverty, and privation of all one\\'s possessions are not perfection, but means of perfection.in these words: \"If anyone ascribes to two persons or subsistences such words as are in the evangelical and apostolic Scriptures, or have been said of Christ by the saints, or by Himself of Himself, and, moreover, applies some of them to the man, taken as distinct from the Word of God, and some of them as if they could be used of God alone only to the Word of God the Father, let   him be anathema.\"First, because it is counter to the authority of   Scripture, in which our Lord makes mention of His soul,I answer that, As Augustine says De Haeres.hypostases, \"such words as are in the evangelical and apostolic Scriptures, or have been said of Christ by the Saints, or by Himself of Himself, and believes that some are to be applied to the Man, and apportions some to the Word alone---let him be anathema.\": \"If anyone say that the Word begotten of God the Father is the God or Lord of Christ, and does not rather confess the same to be at once God and man as the Word made flesh, according to the Scriptures, let him be anathema.\"And therefore He is   most truly called Mediator, as man.I answer that, Nothing is handed down in the canonical Scriptures concerning the sanctification of the Blessed Mary as to her being sanctified in the womb; indeed, they do not even mention her birth.But as Augustine, in his tractate on the Assumption of the Virgin, argues with reason, since her body was assumed into heaven, and yet Scripture does not relate this; so it may be reasonably argued that she was sanctified in the womb.But   it was from the authority of the Sacred Scriptures that He proved to them the truth of His Resurrection, which authority is the basis of faith, when He said: \"All things must needs be fulfilled which are written in the Law, and in the prophets, and in the Psalms, concerning Me\": as is set forthI answer that, Christ manifested His Resurrection in two ways: namely, by testimony; and by proof or sign: and each manifestation was sufficient in its own class.The first of these was the angels\\' testimony, who announced the Resurrection to the women, as is seen in all the Evangelists: the other was the testimony of the Scriptures, which He set before them to   show the truth of the Resurrection, as is narrated in the last chapter of Luke.I answer that, As stated in  Metaphysics, text : \"Whatever is first in any order, is the cause of all that come after it.\"And consequently one who is to be raised to Orders is required to have that knowledge, and to be instructed in Sacred Scripture, not the whole, but more or less, according as his office is of a greater or   lesser extent---to wit, that those who are placed over others, and receive the care of souls, know things pertaining to the doctrine of faith and morals, and that others know whatever concerns the exercise of their Order.I answer that, A cause should be proportionate to its effect.And though after death souls have no bodies assigned to them whereof they be the forms or determinate motors, nevertheless certain corporeal places are appointed to them by way of congruity in reference to their degree of nobility wherein they are as though in a place, after the manner in which incorporeal things can be in a place, according as they more or less approach to the first substance to which the highest   place it fittingly assigned, namely God, whose throne the Scriptures proclaim heaven to be I answer that, Even as in bodies there is gravity or levity whereby they are borne to their own place which is the end of their movement, so in souls there is merit or demerit whereby they reach their reward or punishment, which are the ends of their deeds.This truth is attested by the manifest authority of the canonical Scriptures and the doctrine of the holy Fathers; wherefore the contrary must be judged heretical as stated in Dial.But this opinion   is opposed to the authority of Scripture, because it is written I answer that, The fire in question will in reality, as regards its beginning, precede the judgment.Secondly, because it is more in agreement with Divine Scripture which foretells the resurrection of all; and resurrection is not predicted properly except of that \"which has fallen and perished,\" as the Damascene says De Fide Orth.Hence to maintain that he who rises again is not the selfsame man is heretical, since it is contrary to the truth of Scripture which proclaims the resurrection.I answer that, In this question it makes a difference whether we ask what can be done without prejudice to identity, and what will be done for the sake of congruity.Moreover, when the will is said to move from one place to another, it is not essentially transferred from place to place, because in neither place is it contained essentially, but it is directed to one place after being directed by the intention to another: and in this sense it is said to move from one place to another.I answer that, It is necessary to assert that after the resurrection the bodies of the saints will be lightsome, on account of the authority of Scripture which makes this promise.Indeed our Lord seems to assign this very reason when He said I answer that, We cannot know with any great certainty the manner in which this judgment will take place, nor how men will gather together to the place of judgment; but it may be gathered from Scripture that in all probability He will descend in the neighborhood of Mount Olivet, even as He ascended from there, so as to show that He who descends is the same as He who ascended.I answer that, To judge has several significations.First, because it is in   contradiction to the authority of canonical scripture, as Augustine declares De Videndo Deo: Ep.This cannot be understood except as referring to Purgatory: and whosoever resists the authority of the Church, incurs the note of heresy.I answer that, Nothing is clearly stated in Scripture about the situation of Purgatory, nor is it possible to offer convincing arguments on this question.'"

       " 'The old proverb is right  when it says, “So many heads, so many minds.” Therefore, it is a marvelous work  of God that, overcoming all our perversity, he makes us of one mind, and unites  us together in a pure unity of faith.Here Peter begins to teach how our minds must be prepared if we would make  proper progress in Scripture.',\n",
